 abstract = {Targeting Shiga Prefecture, the study proposed energy utilization scenarios for wood biomass as a nature-based solution (NbS) toward the realization of a zero-carbon society. the study evaluated to quantify co-benefits for the environment, economy and society through implementation of NbS. In addition, it was discussed the behavioral changes required on the user and the factors necessary to realize the scenario when using wood biomass as energy.},
