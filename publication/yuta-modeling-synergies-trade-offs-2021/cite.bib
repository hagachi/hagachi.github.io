 abstract = {For realizing RCES (Regional Circular and Ecological Sphere), it is essential to manage forest from a sustainable and multifaceted perspective that can simultaneously achieve the multiple goals of the SDGs. We simulated the change of vegetation dynamics using a forest landscape simulation model, LANDIS-II. A comparison between forest management scenarios of Shiga prefecture was executed; BaU scenario; the Lake Biwa basic forest management plan. The synergy and trade-offs between carbon sequestration, woody biomass provisioning, and diversity of trees were evaluated. Forest zoning and active forest management increased carbon sequestration and woody biomass provisioning simultaneously and caused little damage to diversity of trees. The contribution to forest management planning that can decarbonize Shiga prefecture without trade-offs between diversity of trees and ecosystem services is expected.},
