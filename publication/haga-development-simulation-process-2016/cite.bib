 abstract = {The sustainable management of Satoyama landscape is a major to realize a society in harmony with nature. To support the sustainable management, quantitative assessment and projection method of biodiversity and ecosystem services in Satoyama landscape is needed. In this study, we developed a simulation process of forest structure and landscape diversity for future scenario assessment. We selected Ishikawa prefecture as a test site. We simulated vegetation succession in 1998 to 2097 by using the LANDIS-II model, a Forest Landscape Model (FLM), under satoyama management scenarios and evaluated the modified Satoyama Index (M-SI). The result shows that management of abandoned farmland has large effect on M-SI value rather than forest management. And we discussed on the utility and future tasks in applying the developed simulation process for future scenario analysis of satoyama landscape.},
