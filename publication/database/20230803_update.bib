	abstract = {Aim: Global flux data analyses have shown a significant positive and linear relationship between site-­scale photosynthetic optimum temperature (Topt-­s) and averaged temperature variables. However, as existing studies have not fully considered species composition, it remains unclear to what extent the change in Topt-­s is derived from intraspecific plasticity or from a difference in species with a consistent species-­specific Topt-­s. We tested these two hypotheses using the satellite-­derived enhanced vegetation index ({EVI}).},

	abstract = {Envisioning positive scenarios that recognize the multiple values of nature is fundamental for designing transformative changes in local socio-ecological systems. This study developed a protocol with three specifications for operationalizing the Nature Futures Framework ({NFF}) in a landscape scenario analysis using a multi-objective optimization framework composed of: (1) exploring nature-positive futures, (2) seeking alternative pathways for targets satisfying visions of plural values, and (3) screening key direct drivers to achieve the targets. This research conducted a case study of a rural landscape in northeastern Japan. First, 110 strategies of landscape management options were simulated from 2015 to 2100 using a forest landscape model, {LANDIS}-{II}. The simulation developed a data frame of four integrated indicators of the {NFF} values for each year and strategy. Second, nature-positive strategies were screened using the common values. Pareto optimal strategies were then identified to obtain equally good solutions. Finally, the key response options to achieve good nature-positive futures were identified using decision tree analysis. Our protocol identified (1) multiple, but few nature-positive and Pareto optimal strategies that satisfied {NFF} visions, (2) nature-positive, but not Pareto optimal strategies, and (3) non-nature-positive strategies. In most Pareto optimal strategies, the maximized value perspectives changed over time. Our protocol also identified key response options to achieve three different {NFF} value perspectives in the case study area: (1) clear or selective cutting in forestry and (2) solar {PV} installation on abandoned pastureland in agriculture and energy sectors. We discussed the implication for local landscape management, localizing {NFF} narratives to develop future scenarios and modeling practice of {NFF}. The protocol does not depend on a specific model and indicator. Thus, our scalable protocol can be applied to scenarios and model practices in any region to support envisioning plausible, feasible, and positive futures, and designing future stakeholder collaboration.},

	abstract = {Built environment stocks have attracted much attention in recent decades because of their role in material and energy flows and environmental impacts. Spatially refined estimation of built environment stocks benefits city management, for example, in urban mining and resource circularity strategy making. Nighttime light ({NTL}) data sets are widely used and are regarded as high-resolution products in large-scale building stock research. However, some of their limitations, especially blooming/saturation effects, have hampered performance in estimating building stocks. In this study, we experimentally proposed and trained a convolution neural network ({CNN})-based building stock estimation ({CBuiSE}) model and applied it to major Japanese metropolitan areas to estimate building stocks using {NTL} data. The results show that the {CBuiSE} model is capable of estimating building stocks at a relatively high resolution (approximately 830 m) and reflecting spatial distribution patterns, although the accuracy needs to be further improved to enhance the model performance. In addition, the {CBuiSE} model can effectively mitigate the overestimation of building stocks arising from the blooming effect of {NTL}. This study highlights the potential of {NTL} to provide a new research direction and serve as a cornerstone for future anthropogenic stock studies in the fields of sustainability and industrial ecology.},
