This study examines the influence of urbanization on the FWLE nexus. Toward this end, land was deemed as an entry point. Therefore, the impact of urbanization on the nexus was explored based on changes in land use. We selected Shenzhen, a city in China, as the study area. First, a land change modeler was employed to analyze historical land-use changes from 2000 to 2010, to build transition potential submodels, and to project future land-use patterns for 2030 under a business-as-usual scenario. Second, based on land-use maps, we assessed habitat quality, water yield, and water supply from 2000 to 2030 using Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs. Moreover, crop production was estimated according to statistical materials. Finally, the study presents the analyses and discussion of the impacts of urbanization on ecosystem services related to the FWLE nexus. The results of land-use changes indicated that a significant expansion of artificial surfaces occurred in Shenzhen with varying degrees of decrease in cultivated land, forest, and grassland. Furthermore, habitat quality, water supply, and crop production decreased evidently due to rapid urbanization. In contrast, the total water yield indicated an upward trend owing to the increased water yield from increasing artificial surfaces, whereas water yield from other land-use areas declined, such as the forest and grassland. The results demonstrated a significant positive correlation between artificial surfaces and total water yield. However, negative correlations were observed in the interaction among habitat quality, water supply, and crop production. The study presented temporal and spatial assessments to provide an effective and convenient means of exploring the interactions and tradeoffs within the FWLE nexus, which, thus, contributed to the sustainable transformation of urbanization.","tags":["\"Ecosystem services\"","\"Food–water–land–ecosystem nexus\"","\"InVEST\"","\"Land-use changes\"","\"Urbanization\""],"title":"Impact of Urbanization on the Food– Water– Land– Ecosystem Nexus: A Study of Shenzhen, China","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tsubasa Nakahira","Taishi Miyamoto","Chihiro Haga","Takanori Matsui","Miho Kamei","Osamu Saito"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1638316800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1642314827,"objectID":"686215a1e054274abba2a96c601ced26","permalink":"https://hagachi.github.io/publication/nakahira-input-output-analysis-japanese-2021/","publishdate":"2022-01-16T06:33:47.589919Z","relpermalink":"/publication/nakahira-input-output-analysis-japanese-2021/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"An Input-Output Analysis of Japanese Industry's Dependency on Nature","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Y.

Although the short-term effects of post-windthrow management have been well studied, we do not have enough knowledge about the long-term effects of post-windthrow management on species composition and biomass recovery. Those effects associated with an increase in the windthrow frequency are also unknown. Although forest landscape models can effectively evaluate these effects, conventional models do not represent the regeneration process on downed logs, which is essential for simulating forest succession. We focused on hemiboreal forests in northern Japan and aimed to (1) incorporate the regeneration process on downed logs into LANDIS-II, which is one of the most used forest landscape models; (2) evaluate the long-term effects of post-windthrow management on tree species composition and aboveground biomass recovery; and (3) evaluate the associated long-term effects of interactions between post-windthrow management and increased windthrow frequency. We incorporated the regeneration process on downed logs into LANDIS-II by regulating the probability of the establishment of species that depend on dead wood, such as spruce, according to the availability of well-decayed dead wood. The incorporation of this process resulted in simulations of trends in species composition and aboveground biomass recovery after post-windthrow management that were more accurate than those produced by the original model. In the modified LANDIS-II simulation, reductions in dead wood and advanced seedlings due to salvage logging had little effect on the tree species composition or aboveground biomass recovery; however, the complete destruction of advanced seedlings by scarification induced a delay in aboveground biomass recovery and a shift to birch-dominated forests that continued for 100~years. In addition, the reduction in dead wood due to salvage logging decreased the number of seedlings, especially of dead wood-dependent species, that established after windthrow. When the windthrow frequency doubled, this decrease in seedlings induced a delay in aboveground biomass recovery, and a substantial decrease in dead wood-dependent species biomass occurred after a subsequent windthrow event. However, after the second windthrow event and following scarification, the forest recovered in the same way as after the first windthrow because the destruction of advanced seedlings and understory plants, namely, dwarf bamboo (Sasa spp.), by scarification reset the site conditions. To conserve the species composition and aboveground biomass of hemiboreal forests under climate change, which is expected to increase windthrow frequency, salvage logging and scarification should be avoided.","tags":["\"Decayed downed logs\"","\"Forest landscape model\"","\"LANDIS-II\"","\"Regeneration\"","\"Salvage logging\"","\"Scarification\""],"title":"Long-Term Cumulative Impacts of Windthrow and Subsequent Management on Tree Species Composition and Aboveground Biomass: A Simulation Study Considering Regeneration on Downed Logs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kataoka Yuta","Chihiro Haga","Takanori Matsui","Takashi Machimura","Kenji Tsuruta","Michinori Kimura"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1638316800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1642314828,"objectID":"a2aa4abd35f0a4b8eced8dd6a2d7bbe2","permalink":"https://hagachi.github.io/publication/yuta-modeling-synergies-trade-offs-2021/","publishdate":"2022-01-16T06:33:48.083399Z","relpermalink":"/publication/yuta-modeling-synergies-trade-offs-2021/","section":"publication","summary":"For realizing RCES (Regional Circular and Ecological Sphere), it is essential to manage forest from a sustainable and multifaceted perspective that can simultaneously achieve the multiple goals of the SDGs.

emissions from fossil fuel combustion (FFCO2) are conventionally estimated from fuel used (as activity data (AD)) and CO2 emissions factor. Recent traffic emission changes under the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic have been estimated using emerging non-fuel consumption data, such as human mobility data that tech companies reported as AD, due to the unavailability of timely fuel statistics. The use of such unconventional activity data (UAD) might allow us to provide emission estimates in near-real time; however, the errors and uncertainties associated with such estimates are expected to be larger than those of common FFCO2 inventory estimates, and thus should be provided along with a thorough evaluation/validation of the methodology and the resulting estimates. Here, we show the impact of COVID-19 on traffic CO2 emissions over the first six months of 2020 in Japan. We calculated CO2 monthly emissions using fuel consumption data and assessed the emission changes relative to 2019. Regardless of Japan's soft approach to COVID-19, traffic emissions significantly declined by 23.8% during the state of emergency in Japan (April– May). We also compared relative emission changes among different estimates available. Our analysis suggests that UAD-based emission estimates during April and May could be biased by -19.6% to 12.6%. We also used traffic count data for examining the performance of UAD as a proxy for traffic and/or CO2 emissions. We found the assumed proportional relationship between traffic changes and CO2 emissions was not enough for estimating emissions with accuracy, and moreover, the traffic-based approach failed to capture emission seasonality. Our study highlighted the challenges and difficulties in repurposing data, especially ones with limited traceability/reproducibility, for modeling human activities and assessing the impact on the environment, and the importance of a thorough error and uncertainty assessment before using these data in policy applications.","tags":[],"title":"Errors and Uncertainties Associated with the Use of Unconventional Activity Data for Estimating CO2 Emissions: The Case for Traffic Emissions in Japan","type":"publication"},{"authors":["健太郎 田中","智宏 芳賀","孝典 松井","啓子 堀","尚 町村"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1627776000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1630985935,"objectID":"a532ee9c9388179ba02d9d4bcb3d65de","permalink":"https://hagachi.github.io/publication/tianzhong-zai-sheng-ke-nengenerugipotensiyaru-kong-jian-ming-shimatupuno-kai-fato-ying-yong-2021/","publishdate":"2021-09-07T03:37:29.196092Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tianzhong-zai-sheng-ke-nengenerugipotensiyaru-kong-jian-ming-shimatupuno-kai-fato-ying-yong-2021/","section":"publication","summary":"The maximum use of renewable energy is expected to promote decarbonization.

However, the uncertainties of socioeconomic development could lead to different changes in the future land-use patterns. Using a spatial downscaling framework, this study aims to explore possible land-use patterns that can help achieve sustainable development in the Guangdong– Hong Kong– Macao Greater Bay Area, China (the Greater Bay Area). The framework combines the global Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) scenarios with local land planning policies to model land-use changes. First, the Land Change Modeler was used to analyze the land-use changes from 2000 to 2010 and build transition potential submodels each of which demonstrates transition potential of different land-use classes. Second, future projections were made for the ``business-as-usual'' scenario and five localized SSP scenarios that were downscaled from global scenarios and modified based on the local land planning policy. Hong Kong was considered a typical case in the Greater Bay Area that could be used to demonstrate the application of the projected land-use maps by comparing the biocapacity and ecological footprint and estimating the carbon emissions associated with land use. The results of the future projections of land use made under six future scenarios indicated that there is a significant expansion in the urban area under all the scenarios, with varying degrees of decrease in cropland and forest among the different scenarios. Moreover, a land-use change also led to the change in local biocapacity and carbon emissions. Our analysis indicated that in achieving sustainable development not only urban area and cropland should be involved for consideration but should also cover the balance between all land-use classes, and three policy implications were proposed based on our findings.","tags":["scenario analysis","biodiversity","ecosystem services","shared socioeconomic pathway"],"title":"A Scenario- and Spatial-Downscaling-Based Land-Use Modeling Framework to Improve the Projections of Plausible Futures: A Case Study of the Guangdong–Hong Kong–Macao Greater Bay Area, China","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"森林生態系は脱炭素化や地域資源利用に向けて地域社会を支える根幹を担う役割が期待されています。そのため気候変動や人間による管理などの自然・人為撹乱によって森林の資源量と質が今後どのように遷移するかを事前に把握することが求められます。そこで本研究課題では、滋賀県を事例として、日本国内の基礎自治体スケールで空間明示的に様々な撹乱に伴う森林の植生動態を将来予測するためのシミュレーションモデルを構築します。具体的には、北米大陸を中心に林業のシナリオ分析のために開発され国内でも利用が進んでいるForest Landscape Model (FLM) を用いて、植生遷移に伴う森林蓄積の頑健な予測モデルの構築を行います。本課題は滋賀県琵琶湖科学研究センターと共同で実施し、滋賀県での事例研究を通じて有用性を評価しつつ、日本国内の他の地域に水平展開するための課題を整理します。研究課題は以下2点です。\n 生物多様性データベースと森林資源情報を用いたパラメータ整備とモデル校正・検証  地域スケールでの森林植生動態モデリングの信頼性向上や迅速かつスケーラブルな水平展開に資するため、パラメータ収集・校正などモデル運用のベストプラクティスの共有基盤を整備します。過去20年間で急速に発展したFLMの研究では欧米を中心とした研究グループが各自にモデルを整備しており、運用知識の共有に課題がありました。そこで、Ready-to-useな植生遷移モデルを整備するべく、国内外の生物多様性データベースや国内のローカルスケールの林業データを活用したFLMモデルの運用プロトコルを開発します。\n 森林植生動態モデリングへの複数の撹乱要因の統合化  実用的な森林植生動態モデリングのため、不確実性が高く影響が大きい撹乱要因の統合シミュレーション環境を構築します。現在、広葉樹林への誘導などで天然更新に注目が集まっていますが、気候変動下やシカの食害など様々な撹乱により更新が失敗することが問題視されています。これまでの空間明示型のモデリング研究では、個々の撹乱の発生確率や影響評価が行われてきました、地域スケールでの統合が課題です。そこで、日本の林業で重要となる複数の撹乱要因を、基礎自治体スケールを対象として植生動態モデリングに高空間分解能で統合を試みます。\nHaga C., Kataoka Y., Matsui T., Tsuruta K., Nakagawa K., Kim J., and Kimura M.

Therefore, monitoring bats helps us to understand the surrounding environmental changes. However, bats are nocturnal, which makes it difficult to visually monitor their behavior. This paper proposes a bat species identifier method based on the analysis of ultrasound called echolocation calls, which is a promising method to monitor bats' activity levels effectively. We develop a robust method to identify the bat species with improved accuracy by analyzing their echolocation calls. First, 1400 sound files with four families, 13 genera, and 30 species were recorded in Japan and the Jincheon-gun in South Korea from 1999 to 2019. Bat echolocation calls were detected from the sound files and used to generate 54,525 spectrograms by applying short-time Fourier transform. We developed a deep learning– based bat species identifier using convolutional neural networks with MobileNetV1 used as the model's architecture. Furthermore, we applied nested cross-validation with the Bayesian optimization algorithm to search for the optimal combination of hyperparameters and evaluate the expected performance. We achieved 98.1% accuracy, which outperformed previous studies that treated more than 30 bat species. We visualized important regions of the spectrograms which correspond to prediction using the Guided Grad-CAM. Moreover, we discussed how to treat the noise class and minimize the model training time. Then, we proposed potential solutions to boost the identifier's performance, the generalization of the echolocation call recording protocols, and applicable techniques to improve the identification accuracy. Future perspectives are 1) to change the deep learning algorithm from image classification to object detection and 2) to apply the proposed identifier to unknown bat echolocation calls to evaluate the feasibility of estimating bat fauna and spatial activity distribution.","tags":["\"Acoustic monitoring\"","\"Convolutional neural networks\"","\"Echolocation call\"","\"Guided Grad-CAM\"","\"Identification\""],"title":"Development of a Species Identification System of Japanese Bats from Echolocation Calls Using Convolutional Neural Networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":" Click on the Slides button above to view the built-in slides feature.   -- ","date":1618272000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1625386194,"objectID":"2d2950ccdd7c92be9d33fa3706171679","permalink":"https://hagachi.github.io/talk/invited-talk-at-icss/","publishdate":"2021-04-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/invited-talk-at-icss/","section":"event","summary":"PANCES scenario case study in Japan","tags":["biodiversity","LANDIS-II"],"title":"Invited talk at ICSS","type":"event"},{"authors":["Yuko Maegawa","Yuji Ushigome","Masato Suzuki","Karen Taguchi","Keigo Kobayashi","Chihiro Haga","Takanori Matsui"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1614556800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1627433728,"objectID":"b0b3e4ee5ba158ee3c8b87d60a566a4f","permalink":"https://hagachi.github.io/publication/maegawa-new-survey-method-2021/","publishdate":"2021-07-03T02:46:28.471683Z","relpermalink":"/publication/maegawa-new-survey-method-2021/","section":"publication","summary":"Habitat and reproduction surveys of raptors are common components of environmental impact assessments. Raptors are few in number and widely dispersed; therefore, raptor surveys require greater survey frequency compared to surveys for many other bird species, which, in turn, may result in extra costs as well as negative impact on raptors caused by observers. In this research, we propose a new, efficient, method for surveying raptors which is low-impact on the raptors themselves. The target species of this study was the Northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis), categorized as ``Near Threatened'' in the Japanese Red List, its population estimated at 5010– 8950 in 2008. We developed a system which can automatically classify five classes of sounds, including goshawk calls, using a convolutional neural network. To establish the system's applicability as a survey method, we then additionally verified three factors; (1) applicability of the method in different locales, (2) optimal distance from the nest to recording device, and (3) the ability to gauge reproductive states. We report an overall accuracy of 97.0% for this system. This system could classify, with high accuracy, goshawk calls ``kek-kek-kek'' and ``whee-oo'' across different locales. This system could classify sounds collected by recorders placed far from nests and within the forest, not placed on the nest itself. Some limitations of the system, notably limitation in data for verification, remain to be improved through further studies. This survey method can be used to judge whether an area was inhabited by goshawks or not, and their approximate reproductive state, based on a three-hour recording of environmental sounds, with required fieldwork limited to the placing and collection of recorders, and minimal additional human input, due to the system classifying the sounds automatically.","tags":["\"Bird call classification\"","\"Bird call detection\"","\"Convolutional neural network (CNN)\"","\"Monitoring\"","\"Northern goshawk\"","\"Raptor surveys\""],"title":"A New Survey Method Using Convolutional Neural Networks for Automatic Classification of Bird Calls","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chihiro Haga","Takanori Matsui","Takahiro Inoue","Wataru Hotta","Masahiro Aiba","Toshiaki Owari","Satoshi N.

Although the risk of disturbance to forest stands by strong winds has long been of interest, we have little knowledge of how the process is mediated by storms and precipitation. Using machine learning, we assess the disturbance risk to cool-temperate forests by typhoons that landed in northern Japan in late August 2016 to determine the features of damage caused by typhoons accompanied by heavy precipitation, discuss how the process is mediated by precipitation as inferred from the modelling results, and delineate the effective solutions for forest management to decrease the future risk in silviculture. In the results, we confirmed two types of behaviours in the model: one represents the same process as that of forest disturbance by strong wind, which has been widely studied, and another represents a unique process mediated by storms and precipitation that has not been previously investigated. Specifically, the ridges that received strong wind from the front side had the highest risk of disturbance. Precipitation increased the probability of disturbance in forest stands, and its effect was dependent on the dominant species composition. Our hypothesis regarding treefall mediated by storms and precipitation is that rainwater flows into the gaps around the tree root systems during sway and the introduction of rainwater below the root-soil plate decreases the root anchorage. The species-specific vulnerability to rainfall may depend on the volume of lateral roots. Modelling the disturbance risk helped us to examine the kinds of factors that were related to exposure and vulnerability that should be managed to effectively decrease the risk of disturbance by typhoons during future uncontrollable hazards. It is recommended to avoid silviculture on the ridges of plateaus considering the high risk estimated in this area. In addition, species with dense lateral roots would be suitable for planting because they may have high resistance to typhoons with heavy precipitation.","tags":["\"Climate change\"","\"Forest structure\"","\"Risk assessment\"","\"Topography\"","\"Total precipitation\"","\"Windthrow\""],"title":"Risk Assessment of Forest Disturbance by Typhoons with Heavy Precipitation in Northern Japan","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Haga, Chihiro","吳恩達"],"categories":["Demo","教程"],"content":"Overview  The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.

introduction of renewable energy (RE) in harmony with nature is essential for building a sustainable society. However, the poorly designed introduction of RE can cause conflicts between energy production and biodiversity conservation. This study conducted a scenario analysis to evaluate potential conflicts in the nexuses between energy and biodiversity for a case study area, the Bekambeushi River watershed located in northeastern Japan. The increasing rate of pastureland abandonment resulting from a decreasing farmer population is a source of great uncertainty in this area. Two alternative sources of RE were selected to utilize these abandoned pasturelands, each taking a contrasting approach to meet targets stipulated by regional energy plans, thereby implying different ecological consequences at the landscape level. Thirty-one RE introduction cases were simulated, comprising a range of pastureland abandonment expansion speeds and ratios of solar photovoltaic (PV) plant installation to biomass energy use. These were superimposed using two IPCC representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios, 2.6 and 8.5, resulting in 62 cases that were summarized as three scenarios based on the RE supply– demand balance and the ecological impacts. The LANDIS-II model was used to simulate these scenarios from 2016 to 2100. The results indicate that both the rate of pastureland abandonment and the ratio of the two RE sources had a large impact on changes in tree species diversity and the habitat suitability of raptorial birds. Abandoned pastureland converted to tree biomass energy production shifted to pioneer species-dominated forest. The plant species composition of transitional forests varied between the climate scenarios. The higher temperature of the RCP 8.5 scenario toward 2100 prevented the establishment of Betula platyphylla and altered tree species diversity and the habitat suitability of Ketupa blakistoni blakistoni. Biomass energy utilization produced less energy than the demand but increased the three ecological indicators. Solar PV systems provided more energy than the regional demand, but the three ecological indicators decreased. However, an appropriate mixture of the two RE sources satisfied the regional energy demand and maintained ecological conditions. Our results suggest that land– energy planning should consider energy– biodiversity nexuses to a strike balance between decarbonization and biodiversity conservation.","tags":["\"Climate Change\"","\"Farmland abandonment\"","\"LANDIS-II\"","\"Renewable energy mix\"","\"Solar Power Generation\"","\"woody biomass energy\""],"title":"Scenario Analysis of Renewable Energy–Biodiversity Nexuses Using a Forest Landscape Model","type":"publication"},{"authors":["啓子 堀","智宏 芳賀","孝典 松井","修 齊藤","禅 橋本","丈人 吉田","琬惠 黄","惇也 熊谷","美保子 若松","俊介 馬奈木"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1630985935,"objectID":"bd09683f72f10066eb951b3f54fdc104","permalink":"https://hagachi.github.io/publication/ku-yi-zhu-yi-xiangto-guan-xi-ren-kouni-guansuru-shi-tai-diao-chato-guan-xi-ren-kouno-du-dao-fu-xian-bie-tui-ji-2020/","publishdate":"2021-09-07T03:37:28.737284Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ku-yi-zhu-yi-xiangto-guan-xi-ren-kouni-guansuru-shi-tai-diao-chato-guan-xi-ren-kouno-du-dao-fu-xian-bie-tui-ji-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["\"dual residence\"","\"estimation of related population\"","\"migration\"","\"related population\"","\"social survey\""],"title":"移住意向と関係人口に関する実態調査と関係人口の都道府県別推計","type":"publication"},{"authors":["隆成 齋藤","千津子 平井","智宏 芳賀","孝典 松井","博章 白川","寛樹 谷川"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1630985935,"objectID":"b793ed18dce897836a9393b0db07fee0","permalink":"https://hagachi.github.io/publication/zhaiteng-wei-xing-ye-jian-guang-qing-baoni-jiduku-shen-ceng-xue-xiniyoru-jian-zhu-wuno-yan-chuang-mian-ji-tui-jini-guansuru-yan-jiu-2020/","publishdate":"2021-09-07T03:37:29.510346Z","relpermalink":"/publication/zhaiteng-wei-xing-ye-jian-guang-qing-baoni-jiduku-shen-ceng-xue-xiniyoru-jian-zhu-wuno-yan-chuang-mian-ji-tui-jini-guansuru-yan-jiu-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["\"Deep Learning\"","\"Material Stock and Flow Analysis\"","\"Nighttime Light data\"","\"Remote Sensing\""],"title":"衛星夜間光情報に基づく深層学習による建築物の延床面積推計に関する研究","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ayana Fujimoto","Chihiro Haga","Takanori Matsui","Takashi Machimura","Kiichiro Hayashi","Satoru Sugita","Hiroaki Takagi"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1564617600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1627433728,"objectID":"7b0a24eaf469b70c8c92eb9f3e028006","permalink":"https://hagachi.github.io/publication/fujimoto-end-end-process-2019-b/","publishdate":"2021-07-03T02:46:27.618636Z","relpermalink":"/publication/fujimoto-end-end-process-2019-b/","section":"publication","summary":"To promote Bio-Energy with Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage (BECCS), which aims to replace fossil fuels with bio energy and store carbon underground, and Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+), which aims to reduce the carbon emissions produced by forest degradation, it is important to build forest management plans based on the scientific prediction of forest dynamics.

However, the unplanned introduction of renewable energies, such as solar power and woody biomass energy, can cause conflicts among energy production, biodiversity, and ecosystem services (BES). In this study, we conducted a scenario analysis of land use management and the selection of renewable energy alternatives to identify such potential conflicts. The case study area was the Bekanbeushi River Watershed in the northeastern Japan. In this watershed, major industries include fishery, forestry, and pasture grass production for dairy farming. However, the population of workers in the primary industry has continuously decreased since 1960. The expansion of abandoned pastureland is considerable issue in this area. In this study, we defined this trend as business as usual scenario. Two alternative scenarios were set to utilize those abandoned pasture lands according to the regional energy plans. One scenario promoted the introduction of the solar power plant on the abandoned pasturelands. The other scenario utilized the production of woody biomass from pioneer species which established on the abandoned pasturelands. The LANDIS-II NECN succession was applied to express the plausible scenarios. And the simulation duration was from 2016 to 2100. The balance of regional energy demand and renewable energy supply, and a habitat suitability index for Blakiston's fish owl, the Satoyama Index were calculated. Moreover, ecosystem services were estimated using the NEE, timber and pasture grass yield, and landscape change. Using those results, we evaluated the energy balance and detected the potential conflicts among renewable energy production and BES. This quantitative, spatially explicit and dynamic ecosystem impact assessment will contribute to the regional stakeholder's decision making for implementing sustainable renewable energy in harmony with nature.","tags":[],"title":"Are There Potential Conflicts among Renewable Energy, Biodiversity, and Ecosystem Services?

This study conducted a quantitative scenario analysis of natural capital and ESs by linking model and social scenarios on a local scale.

The population distribution and capital preference assumptions resulted in different consequences for natural capital and ESs. The population distribution affected the spatial allocation of abandoned pasture land and level of isolation of managed pasture land. The capital preference assumptions largely affected the consequences for ESs. Finally, these simulation results demonstrated the capacity to feed quantitative information to the narrative scenarios.

Land use and land cover in watershed influence nutrient concentrations and fluxes of stream water. In addition, climate change will affect nutrient leaching to stream water through changes of nutrient cycles in terrestrial ecosystem. However, combined effects of land use / land cover and climate changes on nutrient leaching has not been fully understood. We aimed to understand the relationship between land use / land cover distribution and nitrogen concentrations in stream water in a forest, farmland and wetland dominated landscape where productivity of marine resources in the downstream lake play a key role in the local economy. We also aimed to understand the possible consequences of the future land use / land cover changes and climate change in the watershed in terms of nitrogen supply from terrestrial to aquatic ecosystem.   In Bekanbeushi watershed located in eastern Hokkaido, Japan, we conducted a field survey of stream water quality and GIS analysis to understand the relationship between land use and nitrogen concentrations in stream water. The combined effects of land use land cover change and climate change on nitrogen leaching in the watershed was simulated using forest landscape model, LANDIS-II with NECN extension (Scheller et al. 2011). In the model simulation for 2015-2050, we utilized several scenarios that describe the different combinations of the following changes: abandonment of pasture management, changes in tree species composition in forest plantation, and changes in climate factors (i.e., air temperature and precipitation).  The nitrate concentrations in stream water were higher in the watershed where farmland occupies large proportion compared to the watershed where forest and wetland are the main land cover. The pasture abandonment strongly impact on nitrate leaching compared with the changes in species composition in plantation forest. The amount of nitrate leaching in pasture land was affected by land use change than that by climate change, while opposite was the case in forest. These results suggest that effects of changes in land use and climate were different among land use types. We also found that precipitation change was more responsible for the temporal variation of nitrate leaching in future than temperature rise in all scenarios.  Our findings would help the local community make a decision for more sustainable management and environment conservation in both forest and agricultural land of the landscape level.","tags":[],"title":"Combined Effects of Future Changes Land Use/Cover and Climate on Nitrogen Leaching to Stream Water in a Forest, Farmland and Wetland Dominated Landscape, Northern Japan","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chihiro Haga","Takahiro Inoue","Takanori Matsui","Junko Morimoto","Hideaki Shibata","Takashi Machimura"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1535760000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1630985935,"objectID":"0e31cb86152886e3ae8ca1c53fb665d3","permalink":"https://hagachi.github.io/publication/haga-scenario-analysis-landscape-2018/","publishdate":"2021-09-07T03:37:27.988526Z","relpermalink":"/publication/haga-scenario-analysis-landscape-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"Japanese rural society is shrinking, and depopulation and aging are the critical driving forces of under-use of natural resources.  Abandonment of forest and farmland management cause vegetation succession and alter ecosystem services.  To visualize possible prospects taking the uncertainties of social systems into consideration, a scenario approach is effective. The objective is to simulate the landscape dynamics and to analyze the changes in ecosystem services and landscape diversity under plausible future scenarios in the shrinking rural society.  Bekanbeushi Watershed in northern Japan was selected as a study site where the population is continuously decreasing.  This watershed is one of the representative boreal landscapes composed of forest, farmland, and wetland.  We used four national scale narrative scenarios which consisted of the dimensions of population distribution (urban compactification or dispersed population) and people's preference of consumable capital (natural or produced) developed by the Predicting and Assessing Natural Capital and Ecosystem Services (PANCES) project (http://pances.net/eng/). First, to simulate the changes in forest and farmland management, clear-cutting and thinning intensities (% yr-1) and pasture land abandonment rate (km2 yr-1) from 2015 to 2050 were set based on the scenarios.  Second, landscape dynamics under the forestry practice and the expansion of pasture land abandonment were simulated from 2015 to 2050 using a Forest Landscape Model, LANDIS-II NECN succession extension v4.2.  Finally, the conditions of nature (land cover and aboveground biomass) and ecosystem services (carbon sequestration and timber/grass production) were evaluated. The abandonment of pasture land resulted in the expansion of pioneer species (Betula platyphylla Sukaczev) and increased carbon stock.  The forestry practice also induced a trade-off between carbon sequestration in the watershed and timber production during the simulation period.  These results were used to break down the national narrative scenarios. This study simulated the forest landscape changes considering forestry practices and the farmland abandonment and analyzed impacts on terrestrial ecosystem services and landscape diversity.  This approach has applicability to any changing society and contributes to following conference goals; ``Modelling land system change,'' ``Land use drivers and impacts,'' ``Trade-offs for land use and conflict,'' and ``Land change and ecosystem services/biodiversity.''  Moreover, changes in the land cover and the vegetation dynamics in terrestrial ecosystems impact coastal ecosystems through nutrient leaching. Therefore, the discussions of our results with land-ocean scientists will help to understand the interlinkage and contribute to the session's theme ``Land-ocean connectivity and interactions on ecosystem structures, processes and services.''","tags":[],"title":"Scenario Analysis of Landscape Change and Evaluation of Terrestrial Ecosystem Services and Landscape Diversity Using Forest Landscape Model","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Shizuka Hashimoto","Rajarshi DasGupta","Kei Kabaya","Takanori Matsui","Chihiro Haga","Osamu Saito","Kazuhiko Takeuchi"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1533081600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1627433728,"objectID":"6536bb2be7bcb447b2c046bf34063994","permalink":"https://hagachi.github.io/publication/hashimoto-scenario-analysis-landuse-2018/","publishdate":"2021-07-03T02:46:28.173855Z","relpermalink":"/publication/hashimoto-scenario-analysis-landuse-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"Population-decline and subsequent underuse of social-ecological landscapes are increasingly being recognized as one of the crucial drivers behind the loss and deterioration of biodiversity and ecosystem services. In line with this, the study aimed to explore how alternative development pathways influence future land-use patterns, biodiversity and ecosystem services against a rapidly declining population in the Noto peninsula of Japan. By combining land-use simulation and evaluation of ecosystem services, the study formulated four exploratory scenarios for 2050, assuming a contrasting level of the society's reliance on domestic natural capital and different demographic patterns. At first, we analyzeds historical landuse changes between 1997 and 2007 and thereby simulated four plausible alternative scenarios using the Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Network model. These scenarios were further used to quantify ecosystem services and landscape heterogeneity (as biodiversity indicator). The scenario analysis demonstrated that future land-use pattern could vary drastically depending on how the society utilize local natural capital even under the severe depopulation trend, whereas demographic patterns, in general, did not make discernible differences in land-use, biodiversity and ecosystem services. Nevertheless, a land-use change made considerable differences in the level of ecosystem services and landscape heterogeneity with varying degrees. Our analysis suggested that ecosystem services such as food production and nitrogen retention as well as landscape heterogeneity would decrease considerably by 2050 under the scenarios where the utilization of local natural capital decline and a significant amount of farmland are abandoned. Our findings highlight the vital role of land-use and agricultural policy in shaping the future availability of ecosystem services and biodiversity in this area.","tags":[],"title":"Scenario Analysis of Land-Use and Ecosystem Services of Social-Ecological Landscapes: Implications of Alternative Development Pathways under Declining Population in the Noto Peninsula, Japan","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chihiro Haga","Takahiro Inoue","Wataru Hotta","Rei Shibata","Hiroko Kurokawa","Shizuka Hashimoto","Takashi Machimura","Takanori Matsui","Junko Morimoto","Hideaki Shibata"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1512086400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1630985935,"objectID":"f9bc7e00f37cd371dc907fff4d5ba93e","permalink":"https://hagachi.github.io/publication/haga-development-future-scenario-2017/","publishdate":"2021-09-07T03:37:27.533882Z","relpermalink":"/publication/haga-development-future-scenario-2017/","section":"publication","summary":"Quantitative future scenario analysis of Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (BES) plays the key role in facilitating decision making for sustainable management of landscapes.

Regarding climate scenarios, we input monthly climate data in 1 km resolution from statistically downscaled MIROC5 and MRI-CGCM3. Moreover, in association with management scenarios, we translated the qualitative scenarios to quantitative dataframes, and linking them to the input interface of LANDIS-II. We localized LANDIS-II v6.2, NECN succession v4.2, and Biomass Harvest v3.2, and simulated forest succession at 100 m resolution. Finally, we evaluated the expected yields of timber and pasture, carbon stock in the forest and grassland, species composition, and LULC change.

Quantitative and space explicit projection of biodiversity and ecosystem services plays the key role in facilitating effective policy making decisions for the sustainable management of satoyama landscapes. In this study, we developed a simulation process of landscape diversity for future scenario analysis by using the LANDIS-II model (a Forest Landscape Model) and the modified Satoyama index (M-SI). This study simulated the vegetation succession in 1998 to 2097 in Ishikawa prefecture where traditional satoyama and satoumi landscapes widely remain. Under four different satoyama management scenarios, we evaluated the dynamics of landscape diversity for 100-year time span by applying the M-SI. The result suggested that management of abandoned farmland had large impacts on M-SI value rather than forest management. In the scenario of continuing farmland abandonment in the area, the vegetation succession from farmland to the secondary forest was extensively observed. Such shift results in the homogenous landscape and decline of M-SI value over the period. On the other hand, under the scenario of strengthening farmland management, landscape diversity represented by M-SI value would be maintained at a higher level than that of other scenarios. These results imply that our simulation process can contribute to simulating the landscape diversity under different future scenarios, considering with land use change and forest succession.","tags":[],"title":"A Development of Simulation Process of Landscape Diversity in Satoyama Landscapes for Future Scenario Analysis -Using the LANDIS-II Model and the Modified Satoyama Index-","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"このプロジェクトでは主に現在の生態系の状態を観測することに焦点を当てています。\n現在の生態系の状態を把握することは生物多様性保全のために必須ですが、人口減少で人手が減る中で、広域の森林や野生生物を調査するのはとても困難です。そこで、機械学習を用いてドローンや衛星画像から森林属性情報を取得・識別したり、音声録音データから鳥類の種を判別する技術開発を行っています。\n民間企業と分析技術の実装で技術連携しつつ、大学構内や福島県などを対象に研究開発しています。\n","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1627433728,"objectID":"cba1487c4076196d92b5d825849fbf89","permalink":"https://hagachi.github.io/project/ecological-monitoring/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/ecological-monitoring/","section":"project","summary":"This project applied machine learning technologies for biomonitoring.","tags":["biodiversity","acaustic monitoring","machine learning"],"title":"Assisting Biomonitoring using Data-science Technologies","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"生物多様性・再生可能エネルギーのネクサス解明に取り組んでいます。プロジェクトのURLはこちら！ https://github.com/Green-Engineers-Lab/REROUTES\n","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1627433728,"objectID":"fa5df8e3814da9ef8336714f3414345a","permalink":"https://hagachi.github.io/project/nexus/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/nexus/","section":"project","summary":"This project aims to identify nexuses between biodiversity and renewable energy.","tags":["nexus","climate change","biodiversity","ecosystem services"],"title":"Nexus between biodiversity and renewable energy","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"今後日本の森林や農地など陸域生態系は、気候変動の影響を受けつつ、人口減少や再エネ導入など社会からの駆動力で植生が変化することが予想されます。そこで、Forest Landscape Modelを応用し、起こり得る将来シナリオでの植生動態・生態系サービス・野生生物の生息適性の変化をシミュレーションしています。環境・社会・経済の観点から、持続可能な生態系管理の具体化に挑戦しています。\n研究の対象地域は別寒辺牛川流域、道南地域 (北海道)、奥会津地域 (福島県)、石川県、琵琶湖・淀川流域で、私の学士過程から継続中のメインテーマです。\n","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1627433728,"objectID":"2c6529a406ee1bf9153830cea2560d20","permalink":"https://hagachi.github.io/project/scenario-analysis/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/scenario-analysis/","section":"project","summary":"This project conducted scenario analysis of Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services.","tags":["LANDIS-II","climate change","biodiversity","ecosystem services","nexus","scenario analysis"],"title":"Scenario analysis of Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services","type":"project"},{"authors":["Chihiro Haga","Takanori Matsui","Takashi Machimura"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1627433728,"objectID":"b13732fd949747dc9aed38fc9c5a6a81","permalink":"https://hagachi.github.io/publication/haga-development-simulation-process-2016/","publishdate":"2021-07-03T02:46:27.747573Z","relpermalink":"/publication/haga-development-simulation-process-2016/","section":"publication","summary":"The sustainable management of Satoyama landscape is a major to realize a society in harmony with nature. To support the sustainable management, quantitative assessment and projection method of biodiversity and ecosystem services in Satoyama landscape is needed. In this study, we developed a simulation process of forest structure and landscape diversity for future scenario assessment. We selected Ishikawa prefecture as a test site. We simulated vegetation succession in 1998 to 2097 by using the LANDIS-II model, a Forest Landscape Model (FLM), under satoyama management scenarios and evaluated the modified Satoyama Index (M-SI). The result shows that management of abandoned farmland has large effect on M-SI value rather than forest management. And we discussed on the utility and future tasks in applying the developed simulation process for future scenario analysis of satoyama landscape.","tags":["\"abandoned farmland\"","\"forest management\"","\"LANDIS-II\"","\"M-SI\"","\"Satoyama landscapes\""],"title":"A Development of Simulation Process of Landscape Diversity in Satoyama Landscape for Future Scenario Assessment —Using the Landis-Ii Model and the Modified Satoyama Index—","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1625386194,"objectID":"f26b5133c34eec1aa0a09390a36c2ade","permalink":"https://hagachi.github.io/admin/config.yml","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/admin/config.yml","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"wowchemycms"}]
