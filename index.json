This study developed a protocol with three specifications for operationalizing the Nature Futures Framework (NFF) in a landscape scenario analysis using a multi-objective optimization framework composed of: (1) exploring nature-positive futures, (2) seeking alternative pathways for targets satisfying visions of plural values, and (3) screening key direct drivers to achieve the targets. This research conducted a case study of a rural landscape in northeastern Japan. First, 110 strategies of landscape management options were simulated from 2015 to 2100 using a forest landscape model, LANDIS-II. The simulation developed a data frame of four integrated indicators of the NFF values for each year and strategy. Second, nature-positive strategies were screened using the common values. Pareto optimal strategies were then identified to obtain equally good solutions. Finally, the key response options to achieve good nature-positive futures were identified using decision tree analysis. Our protocol identified (1) multiple, but few nature-positive and Pareto optimal strategies that satisfied NFF visions, (2) nature-positive, but not Pareto optimal strategies, and (3) non-nature-positive strategies. In most Pareto optimal strategies, the maximized value perspectives changed over time. Our protocol also identified key response options to achieve three different NFF value perspectives in the case study area: (1) clear or selective cutting in forestry and (2) solar PV installation on abandoned pastureland in agriculture and energy sectors. We discussed the implication for local landscape management, localizing NFF narratives to develop future scenarios and modeling practice of NFF. The protocol does not depend on a specific model and indicator. Thus, our scalable protocol can be applied to scenarios and model practices in any region to support envisioning plausible, feasible, and positive futures, and designing future stakeholder collaboration.","tags":["Scenario analysis","Forest landscape model","Forestry","Agriculture","Nature positive"],"title":"Modeling desirable futures at local scale by combining the nature futures framework and multi-objective optimization","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zhiwei Liu","Ryusei Saito","Jing Guo","Chizuko Hirai","Chihiro Haga","Takanori Matsui","Hiroaki Shirakawa","Hiroki Tanikawa"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1678147200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1691052796,"objectID":"5514fbfe5a8f6649d033b7b2880d0a5f","permalink":"https://hagachi.github.io/publication/liu-does-2023/","publishdate":"2023-08-03T08:29:26.67651Z","relpermalink":"/publication/liu-does-2023/","section":"publication","summary":"Built environment stocks have attracted much attention in recent decades because of their role in material and energy flows and environmental impacts. Spatially refined estimation of built environment stocks benefits city management, for example, in urban mining and resource circularity strategy making. Nighttime light (NTL) data sets are widely used and are regarded as high-resolution products in large-scale building stock research. However, some of their limitations, especially blooming/saturation effects, have hampered performance in estimating building stocks. In this study, we experimentally proposed and trained a convolution neural network (CNN)-based building stock estimation (CBuiSE) model and applied it to major Japanese metropolitan areas to estimate building stocks using NTL data. The results show that the CBuiSE model is capable of estimating building stocks at a relatively high resolution (approximately 830 m) and reflecting spatial distribution patterns, although the accuracy needs to be further improved to enhance the model performance. In addition, the CBuiSE model can effectively mitigate the overestimation of building stocks arising from the blooming effect of NTL. This study highlights the potential of NTL to provide a new research direction and serve as a cornerstone for future anthropogenic stock studies in the fields of sustainability and industrial ecology.","tags":[],"title":"Does Deep Learning Enhance the Estimation for Spatially Explicit Built Environment Stocks through Nighttime Light Data Set?

Thus, post-windthrow management, which can enhance tree recovery in wind-disturbed forests with dense understory species, is essential for sus­ tainable forest management to adapt to climate change. This study explores management options that can recover the above-ground biomass (AGB) and tree species composition after windthrow damage even under climate change. A case study area was established in the Oshima– Hiyama National Forest in southern Hokkaido, northern Japan, which were damaged by typhoons in late August 2016. We incorporated the understory species Sasa kurilensis as understory vegetation into the LANDIS-II Net Ecosystem Carbon and Nitrogen Succession extension v6.3 model to simulate the outcome of tree establishment under climate change. AGB recovery up to the year 2100 at 1,753 damaged grid cells was simulated for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change representative concentration pathway (RCP) 2.6 and 8.5 scenarios. Different post-windthrow management cases were designed by varying the treatment of fallen trees and the types of trees planted. The results demonstrated that salvage logging and planting successfully recovered the AGB by 2050 at the landscape scale regardless of the climate change scenario, whereas leaving fallen trees in the damaged site or salvage logging only did not facilitate the recovery of AGB. Leaving fallen trees in damaged grid cells as ecological legacies recovered the AGB only in damaged grid cells with a sufficient number of advanced seedlings of adequate types of species irre­ spective of the climate change scenario. The decreasing water equivalent of snowpack in the RCP scenarios caused Sasa kurilensis mortality and promoted the recovery of AGB of trees. The dominant species recovered in natural forests, which experienced either salvage logging or leaving trees in the damaged site, varied among climate change scenarios. The warmer climate condition facilitated the recovery of Fagus crenata by 2100. These results can help designing a robust forest recovery even in uncertain future climate.","tags":[],"title":"Modeling Tree Recovery in Wind-Disturbed Forests with Dense Understory Species under Climate Change","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1663891200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1691119523,"objectID":"b102855c26af35172fd8e0c30106bc4c","permalink":"https://hagachi.github.io/talk/oral-presentation-%E7%94%9F%E7%89%A9%E5%A4%9A%E6%A7%98%E6%80%A7%E3%82%92%E8%80%83%E3%81%88%E3%82%8B/","publishdate":"2022-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/oral-presentation-%E7%94%9F%E7%89%A9%E5%A4%9A%E6%A7%98%E6%80%A7%E3%82%92%E8%80%83%E3%81%88%E3%82%8B/","section":"event","summary":"市民向けワークショップ","tags":["nature","biodiversity"],"title":"Oral Presentation \"生物多様性を考える\"","type":"event"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1656460800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1691119523,"objectID":"b99cda7db228b0915034acad080d9de1","permalink":"https://hagachi.github.io/talk/online-oral-presentation-modelling-a-landscape-using-nature-futures-framework.-a-case-study-in-japan/","publishdate":"2022-06-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/online-oral-presentation-modelling-a-landscape-using-nature-futures-framework.-a-case-study-in-japan/","section":"event","summary":"Nature Futures Frameworkを応用したシナリオ分析事例紹介","tags":["nature","direct driver","biodiversity","LANDIS-II"],"title":"Online Oral Presentation \"Modelling a landscape using nature futures framework. a case study in japan\"","type":"event"},{"authors":["Chihiro Haga","Marimi Maeda","Wataru Hotta","Takanori Matsui","Masahiro Nakaoka","Junko Morimoto","Hideaki Shibata","Shizuka Hashimoto","Osamu Saito","Sana Okayasu","HyeJin Kim","Garry Peterson"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1654041600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1691119523,"objectID":"dd9207bb9e7772912999f94720e98567","permalink":"https://hagachi.github.io/publication/haga-modelling-landscape-using-2022/","publishdate":"2022-11-10T04:34:53.081453Z","relpermalink":"/publication/haga-modelling-landscape-using-2022/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Modelling a Landscape Using Nature Futures Framework: A Case Study in Japan","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kentaro Tanaka","Chihiro Haga","Keiko Hori","Takanori Matsui"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1648771200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1691119523,"objectID":"e613ad81a9314bf2590b06d7ee6f8d03","permalink":"https://hagachi.github.io/publication/tanaka-renewable-energy-nexus-2022/","publishdate":"2022-04-25T09:31:43.00181Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tanaka-renewable-energy-nexus-2022/","section":"publication","summary":"Renewable energy is one of the most important sources of energy for a decarbonized future. The use of renewable energy necessitates the thorough study of interlinkages with social issues such as the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, there are no high-resolution renewable energy datasets for analyzing interlinkages. The goal of this research is to 1) create a high-resolution geographically explicit renewable energy potential map, 2) evaluate the SDGs nexus using the potential map, 3) discuss the improvement of renewable energy dataset, and 4) discuss nexus issues for implementing renewable energy systems in Japan. Our potential map has the same resolution of 500 m and unit of annual electricity generation on each energy. The occurence of endangered birds was overlapping with the area having a lot of solar energy potential. Local renewable energy is difficult to access on a small spatial scale, especially in urban regions like Tokyo. Our potential map can be used as a database for site selection and area zoning. The findings suggest that implementing decentralized renewable energy systems in today's highly concentrated megacities, such as the Tokyo Metropolitan Area, is extremely challenging, and that this type of centralized-oriented land design is likely to exacerbate the problem of energy poverty.","tags":["\"decision support\"","\"endangered birds\"","\"energy access\"","\"energy poverty\"","\"renewable energy map\"","nexus"],"title":"Renewable Energy Nexus: Interlinkages with Biodiversity and Social Issues in Japan","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"佐渡市では、人口減少・高齢化による管理放棄林や耕作放棄地の増加に加え、脱炭素を目的とした再エネの導入が計画されています。今後2050年に向かって、脱炭素化することを前提条件とした時に、生物多様性保全や地域の産業振興はどのようになっていくのか？この問いに答えていくプロジェクトです。私はLANDIS-IIモデルの運用担当として参画しています。耕作放棄地の植生遷移のモデル化にも取り組む、挑戦的な課題です。 関連する研究プロジェクト: S21-5(2) 「里山ランドスケープを対象にした統合評価・シナリオ分析と社会適用（代表: 関島恒夫）」\n","date":1648771200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1691119523,"objectID":"ec1d50df24e4da9a9f17be7f92059415","permalink":"https://hagachi.github.io/project/s21-52/","publishdate":"2022-04-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/s21-52/","section":"project","summary":"Sado city, Japan","tags":["indirect driver","direct driver","nature","ncp"],"title":"S21-5(2) 里山ランドスケープを対象にした統合評価・シナリオ分析と社会適用","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1647302400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1691119523,"objectID":"8ac1b5f35938ebc64f02a6477aaec9d2","permalink":"https://hagachi.github.io/talk/online-poster-%E5%9C%B0%E6%96%B9%E8%87%AA%E6%B2%BB%E4%BD%93%E3%82%B9%E3%82%B1%E3%83%BC%E3%83%AB%E3%81%A6%E3%81%AE%E6%A3%AE%E6%9E%97%E5%8B%95%E6%85%8B%E3%83%A2%E3%83%86%E3%83%AA%E3%83%B3%E3%82%AF/","publishdate":"2022-03-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/online-poster-%E5%9C%B0%E6%96%B9%E8%87%AA%E6%B2%BB%E4%BD%93%E3%82%B9%E3%82%B1%E3%83%BC%E3%83%AB%E3%81%A6%E3%81%AE%E6%A3%AE%E6%9E%97%E5%8B%95%E6%85%8B%E3%83%A2%E3%83%86%E3%83%AA%E3%83%B3%E3%82%AF/","section":"event","summary":"森林簿の検証とRSデータを用いた森林動態モデリングの検討","tags":["nature","biodiversity","LANDIS-II"],"title":"Online Poster \"地方自治体スケールでの森林動態モデリング\"","type":"event"},{"authors":["Xiangyun Shi","Takanori Matsui","Takashi Machimura","Chihiro Haga","Ang Hu","Xiaoyu Gan"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1643673600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1642315208,"objectID":"2f50e79909565da7627c7b4d882bb5c4","permalink":"https://hagachi.github.io/publication/shi-impact-urbanization-food-2022/","publishdate":"2022-01-16T06:33:47.916043Z","relpermalink":"/publication/shi-impact-urbanization-food-2022/","section":"publication","summary":"The food– water– land– ecosystem (FWLE) nexus is fundamental for achieving sustainable development. This study examines the influence of urbanization on the FWLE nexus. Toward this end, land was deemed as an entry point. Therefore, the impact of urbanization on the nexus was explored based on changes in land use. We selected Shenzhen, a city in China, as the study area. First, a land change modeler was employed to analyze historical land-use changes from 2000 to 2010, to build transition potential submodels, and to project future land-use patterns for 2030 under a business-as-usual scenario. Second, based on land-use maps, we assessed habitat quality, water yield, and water supply from 2000 to 2030 using Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs. Moreover, crop production was estimated according to statistical materials. Finally, the study presents the analyses and discussion of the impacts of urbanization on ecosystem services related to the FWLE nexus. The results of land-use changes indicated that a significant expansion of artificial surfaces occurred in Shenzhen with varying degrees of decrease in cultivated land, forest, and grassland. Furthermore, habitat quality, water supply, and crop production decreased evidently due to rapid urbanization. In contrast, the total water yield indicated an upward trend owing to the increased water yield from increasing artificial surfaces, whereas water yield from other land-use areas declined, such as the forest and grassland. The results demonstrated a significant positive correlation between artificial surfaces and total water yield. However, negative correlations were observed in the interaction among habitat quality, water supply, and crop production. The study presented temporal and spatial assessments to provide an effective and convenient means of exploring the interactions and tradeoffs within the FWLE nexus, which, thus, contributed to the sustainable transformation of urbanization.","tags":["\"Ecosystem services\"","\"Food–water–land–ecosystem nexus\"","\"InVEST\"","\"Land-use changes\"","\"Urbanization\""],"title":"Impact of Urbanization on the Food– Water– Land– Ecosystem Nexus: A Study of Shenzhen, China","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tsubasa Nakahira","Taishi Miyamoto","Chihiro Haga","Takanori Matsui","Miho Kamei","Osamu Saito"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1638316800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1642315208,"objectID":"686215a1e054274abba2a96c601ced26","permalink":"https://hagachi.github.io/publication/nakahira-input-output-analysis-japanese-2021/","publishdate":"2022-01-16T06:33:47.589919Z","relpermalink":"/publication/nakahira-input-output-analysis-japanese-2021/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"An Input-Output Analysis of Japanese Industry's Dependency on Nature","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Y.

We focused on hemiboreal forests in northern Japan and aimed to (1) incorporate the regeneration process on downed logs into LANDIS-II, which is one of the most used forest landscape models; (2) evaluate the long-term effects of post-windthrow management on tree species composition and aboveground biomass recovery; and (3) evaluate the associated long-term effects of interactions between post-windthrow management and increased windthrow frequency. We incorporated the regeneration process on downed logs into LANDIS-II by regulating the probability of the establishment of species that depend on dead wood, such as spruce, according to the availability of well-decayed dead wood. The incorporation of this process resulted in simulations of trends in species composition and aboveground biomass recovery after post-windthrow management that were more accurate than those produced by the original model. In the modified LANDIS-II simulation, reductions in dead wood and advanced seedlings due to salvage logging had little effect on the tree species composition or aboveground biomass recovery; however, the complete destruction of advanced seedlings by scarification induced a delay in aboveground biomass recovery and a shift to birch-dominated forests that continued for 100~years. In addition, the reduction in dead wood due to salvage logging decreased the number of seedlings, especially of dead wood-dependent species, that established after windthrow. When the windthrow frequency doubled, this decrease in seedlings induced a delay in aboveground biomass recovery, and a substantial decrease in dead wood-dependent species biomass occurred after a subsequent windthrow event. However, after the second windthrow event and following scarification, the forest recovered in the same way as after the first windthrow because the destruction of advanced seedlings and understory plants, namely, dwarf bamboo (Sasa spp.), by scarification reset the site conditions. To conserve the species composition and aboveground biomass of hemiboreal forests under climate change, which is expected to increase windthrow frequency, salvage logging and scarification should be avoided.","tags":["\"Decayed downed logs\"","\"Forest landscape model\"","\"LANDIS-II\"","\"Regeneration\"","\"Salvage logging\"","\"Scarification\""],"title":"Long-Term Cumulative Impacts of Windthrow and Subsequent Management on Tree Species Composition and Aboveground Biomass: A Simulation Study Considering Regeneration on Downed Logs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kataoka Yuta","Chihiro Haga","Takanori Matsui","Takashi Machimura","Kenji Tsuruta","Michinori Kimura"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1638316800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1642315208,"objectID":"a2aa4abd35f0a4b8eced8dd6a2d7bbe2","permalink":"https://hagachi.github.io/publication/yuta-modeling-synergies-trade-offs-2021/","publishdate":"2022-01-16T06:33:48.083399Z","relpermalink":"/publication/yuta-modeling-synergies-trade-offs-2021/","section":"publication","summary":"For realizing RCES (Regional Circular and Ecological Sphere), it is essential to manage forest from a sustainable and multifaceted perspective that can simultaneously achieve the multiple goals of the SDGs.

emissions from fossil fuel combustion (FFCO2) are conventionally estimated from fuel used (as activity data (AD)) and CO2 emissions factor. Recent traffic emission changes under the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic have been estimated using emerging non-fuel consumption data, such as human mobility data that tech companies reported as AD, due to the unavailability of timely fuel statistics. The use of such unconventional activity data (UAD) might allow us to provide emission estimates in near-real time; however, the errors and uncertainties associated with such estimates are expected to be larger than those of common FFCO2 inventory estimates, and thus should be provided along with a thorough evaluation/validation of the methodology and the resulting estimates. Here, we show the impact of COVID-19 on traffic CO2 emissions over the first six months of 2020 in Japan. We calculated CO2 monthly emissions using fuel consumption data and assessed the emission changes relative to 2019. Regardless of Japan's soft approach to COVID-19, traffic emissions significantly declined by 23.8% during the state of emergency in Japan (April– May). We also compared relative emission changes among different estimates available. Our analysis suggests that UAD-based emission estimates during April and May could be biased by -19.6% to 12.6%. We also used traffic count data for examining the performance of UAD as a proxy for traffic and/or CO2 emissions. We found the assumed proportional relationship between traffic changes and CO2 emissions was not enough for estimating emissions with accuracy, and moreover, the traffic-based approach failed to capture emission seasonality. Our study highlighted the challenges and difficulties in repurposing data, especially ones with limited traceability/reproducibility, for modeling human activities and assessing the impact on the environment, and the importance of a thorough error and uncertainty assessment before using these data in policy applications.","tags":[],"title":"Errors and Uncertainties Associated with the Use of Unconventional Activity Data for Estimating CO2 Emissions: The Case for Traffic Emissions in Japan","type":"publication"},{"authors":["健太郎 田中","智宏 芳賀","孝典 松井","啓子 堀","尚 町村"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1627776000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1630985935,"objectID":"a532ee9c9388179ba02d9d4bcb3d65de","permalink":"https://hagachi.github.io/publication/tianzhong-zai-sheng-ke-nengenerugipotensiyaru-kong-jian-ming-shimatupuno-kai-fato-ying-yong-2021/","publishdate":"2021-09-07T03:37:29.196092Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tianzhong-zai-sheng-ke-nengenerugipotensiyaru-kong-jian-ming-shimatupuno-kai-fato-ying-yong-2021/","section":"publication","summary":"The maximum use of renewable energy is expected to promote decarbonization.

However, the uncertainties of socioeconomic development could lead to different changes in the future land-use patterns. Using a spatial downscaling framework, this study aims to explore possible land-use patterns that can help achieve sustainable development in the Guangdong– Hong Kong– Macao Greater Bay Area, China (the Greater Bay Area). The framework combines the global Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) scenarios with local land planning policies to model land-use changes. First, the Land Change Modeler was used to analyze the land-use changes from 2000 to 2010 and build transition potential submodels each of which demonstrates transition potential of different land-use classes. Second, future projections were made for the ``business-as-usual'' scenario and five localized SSP scenarios that were downscaled from global scenarios and modified based on the local land planning policy. Hong Kong was considered a typical case in the Greater Bay Area that could be used to demonstrate the application of the projected land-use maps by comparing the biocapacity and ecological footprint and estimating the carbon emissions associated with land use. The results of the future projections of land use made under six future scenarios indicated that there is a significant expansion in the urban area under all the scenarios, with varying degrees of decrease in cropland and forest among the different scenarios. Moreover, a land-use change also led to the change in local biocapacity and carbon emissions. Our analysis indicated that in achieving sustainable development not only urban area and cropland should be involved for consideration but should also cover the balance between all land-use classes, and three policy implications were proposed based on our findings.","tags":["scenario analysis","biodiversity","ecosystem services","shared socioeconomic pathway"],"title":"A Scenario- and Spatial-Downscaling-Based Land-Use Modeling Framework to Improve the Projections of Plausible Futures: A Case Study of the Guangdong–Hong Kong–Macao Greater Bay Area, China","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"滋賀県では、地域の脱炭素を目指した「滋賀県CO₂ネットゼロ社会づくり推進計画」や、森林の保全・持続可能な利用を目指した「琵琶湖森林づくり基本計画」が個別に策定されています。では、ネットゼロを達成した社会では、どのような森林管理が可能なのか、また、どのような森林管理が求められるのでしょうか？このプロジェクトでは、地域版統合評価モデルと森林景観モデルのオフラインカップリングにより、これらの問いに空間明示に応えられるようなモデルを開発しています。\n","date":1625097600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1691119523,"objectID":"6709e2a55ef4d29e831635821ebc83b5","permalink":"https://hagachi.github.io/project/scenario-shiga/","publishdate":"2021-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/scenario-shiga/","section":"project","summary":"Shiga Prefecture, Japan","tags":["indirect driver","direct driver","nature","ncp"],"title":"Integrated Modeling of Landscape and Socio-Economic Systems Change at Local Scale","type":"project"},{"authors":["Chihiro Haga"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1625097600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1630985935,"objectID":"9dfb197c4f2ad99c84ba0c9b271e12e0","permalink":"https://hagachi.github.io/publication/haga-mainstreaming-renewable-energy-2021/","publishdate":"2021-09-07T03:37:27.842868Z","relpermalink":"/publication/haga-mainstreaming-renewable-energy-2021/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Mainstreaming Renewable Energy in Decade of Action Requires Ecologists","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"フードシステムは、気候変動・生物多様性の両分野にとって重要な間接要因です。このため、近年EAT-Lancetが「Planetary Health Diet」を提唱し、人間にとっても地球にとっても健康な食事法を提案しました。日本国内でも国内のフードシステムの現況を反映したフードガイドの提案などが進められています。そこで本プロジェクトでは、まずは日本国民の食事がPlanetary Health Dietと比較し、日本の食事の問題点・指標の問題点を整理するところから初めています。\n","date":1625097600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1691119523,"objectID":"db54cc2ed39891a9d0ea2c1b3c475a8c","permalink":"https://hagachi.github.io/project/foodsystem/","publishdate":"2021-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/foodsystem/","section":"project","summary":"Japan","tags":["indirect driver","nature"],"title":"Planetary Health Diet","type":"project"},{"authors":["Keigo Kobayashi","Keisuke Masuda","Chihiro Haga","Takanori Matsui","Dai Fukui","Takashi Machimura"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1619827200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1691119523,"objectID":"f08247049d8b3e95457297cbb0a3f48c","permalink":"https://hagachi.github.io/publication/kobayashi-development-species-identification-2021-a/","publishdate":"2021-07-03T02:46:28.32846Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kobayashi-development-species-identification-2021-a/","section":"publication","summary":"Bats inhabit all continents except Antarctica, and they have enormous potential as bioindicators. Therefore, monitoring bats helps us to understand the surrounding environmental changes. However, bats are nocturnal, which makes it difficult to visually monitor their behavior. This paper proposes a bat species identifier method based on the analysis of ultrasound called echolocation calls, which is a promising method to monitor bats' activity levels effectively. We develop a robust method to identify the bat species with improved accuracy by analyzing their echolocation calls. First, 1400 sound files with four families, 13 genera, and 30 species were recorded in Japan and the Jincheon-gun in South Korea from 1999 to 2019. Bat echolocation calls were detected from the sound files and used to generate 54,525 spectrograms by applying short-time Fourier transform. We developed a deep learning– based bat species identifier using convolutional neural networks with MobileNetV1 used as the model's architecture. Furthermore, we applied nested cross-validation with the Bayesian optimization algorithm to search for the optimal combination of hyperparameters and evaluate the expected performance. We achieved 98.1% accuracy, which outperformed previous studies that treated more than 30 bat species. We visualized important regions of the spectrograms which correspond to prediction using the Guided Grad-CAM. Moreover, we discussed how to treat the noise class and minimize the model training time. Then, we proposed potential solutions to boost the identifier's performance, the generalization of the echolocation call recording protocols, and applicable techniques to improve the identification accuracy. Future perspectives are 1) to change the deep learning algorithm from image classification to object detection and 2) to apply the proposed identifier to unknown bat echolocation calls to evaluate the feasibility of estimating bat fauna and spatial activity distribution.","tags":["\"Acoustic monitoring\"","\"Convolutional neural networks\"","\"Echolocation call\"","\"Guided Grad-CAM\"","\"Identification\""],"title":"Development of a Species Identification System of Japanese Bats from Echolocation Calls Using Convolutional Neural Networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1618272000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1625386194,"objectID":"2d2950ccdd7c92be9d33fa3706171679","permalink":"https://hagachi.github.io/talk/invited-talk-at-icss/","publishdate":"2021-04-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/invited-talk-at-icss/","section":"event","summary":"PANCES scenario case study in Japan","tags":["biodiversity","LANDIS-II"],"title":"Invited talk at ICSS","type":"event"},{"authors":["Yuko Maegawa","Yuji Ushigome","Masato Suzuki","Karen Taguchi","Keigo Kobayashi","Chihiro Haga","Takanori Matsui"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1614556800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1691119523,"objectID":"b0b3e4ee5ba158ee3c8b87d60a566a4f","permalink":"https://hagachi.github.io/publication/maegawa-new-survey-method-2021/","publishdate":"2021-07-03T02:46:28.471683Z","relpermalink":"/publication/maegawa-new-survey-method-2021/","section":"publication","summary":"Habitat and reproduction surveys of raptors are common components of environmental impact assessments. Raptors are few in number and widely dispersed; therefore, raptor surveys require greater survey frequency compared to surveys for many other bird species, which, in turn, may result in extra costs as well as negative impact on raptors caused by observers. In this research, we propose a new, efficient, method for surveying raptors which is low-impact on the raptors themselves. The target species of this study was the Northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis), categorized as ``Near Threatened'' in the Japanese Red List, its population estimated at 5010– 8950 in 2008. We developed a system which can automatically classify five classes of sounds, including goshawk calls, using a convolutional neural network. To establish the system's applicability as a survey method, we then additionally verified three factors; (1) applicability of the method in different locales, (2) optimal distance from the nest to recording device, and (3) the ability to gauge reproductive states. We report an overall accuracy of 97.0% for this system. This system could classify, with high accuracy, goshawk calls ``kek-kek-kek'' and ``whee-oo'' across different locales. This system could classify sounds collected by recorders placed far from nests and within the forest, not placed on the nest itself.

Although the risk of disturbance to forest stands by strong winds has long been of interest, we have little knowledge of how the process is mediated by storms and precipitation. Using machine learning, we assess the disturbance risk to cool-temperate forests by typhoons that landed in northern Japan in late August 2016 to determine the features of damage caused by typhoons accompanied by heavy precipitation, discuss how the process is mediated by precipitation as inferred from the modelling results, and delineate the effective solutions for forest management to decrease the future risk in silviculture. In the results, we confirmed two types of behaviours in the model: one represents the same process as that of forest disturbance by strong wind, which has been widely studied, and another represents a unique process mediated by storms and precipitation that has not been previously investigated. Specifically, the ridges that received strong wind from the front side had the highest risk of disturbance. Precipitation increased the probability of disturbance in forest stands, and its effect was dependent on the dominant species composition. Our hypothesis regarding treefall mediated by storms and precipitation is that rainwater flows into the gaps around the tree root systems during sway and the introduction of rainwater below the root-soil plate decreases the root anchorage. The species-specific vulnerability to rainfall may depend on the volume of lateral roots. Modelling the disturbance risk helped us to examine the kinds of factors that were related to exposure and vulnerability that should be managed to effectively decrease the risk of disturbance by typhoons during future uncontrollable hazards. It is recommended to avoid silviculture on the ridges of plateaus considering the high risk estimated in this area. In addition, species with dense lateral roots would be suitable for planting because they may have high resistance to typhoons with heavy precipitation.","tags":["\"Climate change\"","\"Forest structure\"","\"Risk assessment\"","\"Topography\"","\"Total precipitation\"","\"Windthrow\""],"title":"Risk Assessment of Forest Disturbance by Typhoons with Heavy Precipitation in Northern Japan","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Haga, Chihiro","吳恩達"],"categories":["Demo","教程"],"content":"Overview The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.

introduction of renewable energy (RE) in harmony with nature is essential for building a sustainable society. However, the poorly designed introduction of RE can cause conflicts between energy production and biodiversity conservation. This study conducted a scenario analysis to evaluate potential conflicts in the nexuses between energy and biodiversity for a case study area, the Bekambeushi River watershed located in northeastern Japan. The increasing rate of pastureland abandonment resulting from a decreasing farmer population is a source of great uncertainty in this area. Two alternative sources of RE were selected to utilize these abandoned pasturelands, each taking a contrasting approach to meet targets stipulated by regional energy plans, thereby implying different ecological consequences at the landscape level. Thirty-one RE introduction cases were simulated, comprising a range of pastureland abandonment expansion speeds and ratios of solar photovoltaic (PV) plant installation to biomass energy use. These were superimposed using two IPCC representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios, 2.6 and 8.5, resulting in 62 cases that were summarized as three scenarios based on the RE supply– demand balance and the ecological impacts. The LANDIS-II model was used to simulate these scenarios from 2016 to 2100. The results indicate that both the rate of pastureland abandonment and the ratio of the two RE sources had a large impact on changes in tree species diversity and the habitat suitability of raptorial birds. Abandoned pastureland converted to tree biomass energy production shifted to pioneer species-dominated forest. The plant species composition of transitional forests varied between the climate scenarios. The higher temperature of the RCP 8.5 scenario toward 2100 prevented the establishment of Betula platyphylla and altered tree species diversity and the habitat suitability of Ketupa blakistoni blakistoni. Biomass energy utilization produced less energy than the demand but increased the three ecological indicators. Solar PV systems provided more energy than the regional demand, but the three ecological indicators decreased. However, an appropriate mixture of the two RE sources satisfied the regional energy demand and maintained ecological conditions. Our results suggest that land– energy planning should consider energy– biodiversity nexuses to a strike balance between decarbonization and biodiversity conservation.","tags":["\"Climate Change\"","\"Farmland abandonment\"","\"LANDIS-II\"","\"Renewable energy mix\"","\"Solar Power Generation\"","\"woody biomass energy\""],"title":"Scenario Analysis of Renewable Energy–Biodiversity Nexuses Using a Forest Landscape Model","type":"publication"},{"authors":["啓子 堀","智宏 芳賀","孝典 松井","修 齊藤","禅 橋本","丈人 吉田","琬惠 黄","惇也 熊谷","美保子 若松","俊介 馬奈木"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1630985935,"objectID":"bd09683f72f10066eb951b3f54fdc104","permalink":"https://hagachi.github.io/publication/ku-yi-zhu-yi-xiangto-guan-xi-ren-kouni-guansuru-shi-tai-diao-chato-guan-xi-ren-kouno-du-dao-fu-xian-bie-tui-ji-2020/","publishdate":"2021-09-07T03:37:28.737284Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ku-yi-zhu-yi-xiangto-guan-xi-ren-kouni-guansuru-shi-tai-diao-chato-guan-xi-ren-kouno-du-dao-fu-xian-bie-tui-ji-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["\"dual residence\"","\"estimation of related population\"","\"migration\"","\"related population\"","\"social survey\""],"title":"移住意向と関係人口に関する実態調査と関係人口の都道府県別推計","type":"publication"},{"authors":["隆成 齋藤","千津子 平井","智宏 芳賀","孝典 松井","博章 白川","寛樹 谷川"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1630985935,"objectID":"b793ed18dce897836a9393b0db07fee0","permalink":"https://hagachi.github.io/publication/zhaiteng-wei-xing-ye-jian-guang-qing-baoni-jiduku-shen-ceng-xue-xiniyoru-jian-zhu-wuno-yan-chuang-mian-ji-tui-jini-guansuru-yan-jiu-2020/","publishdate":"2021-09-07T03:37:29.510346Z","relpermalink":"/publication/zhaiteng-wei-xing-ye-jian-guang-qing-baoni-jiduku-shen-ceng-xue-xiniyoru-jian-zhu-wuno-yan-chuang-mian-ji-tui-jini-guansuru-yan-jiu-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["\"Deep Learning\"","\"Material Stock and Flow Analysis\"","\"Nighttime Light data\"","\"Remote Sensing\""],"title":"衛星夜間光情報に基づく深層学習による建築物の延床面積推計に関する研究","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ayana Fujimoto","Chihiro Haga","Takanori Matsui","Takashi Machimura","Kiichiro Hayashi","Satoru Sugita","Hiroaki Takagi"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1564617600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1627433728,"objectID":"7b0a24eaf469b70c8c92eb9f3e028006","permalink":"https://hagachi.github.io/publication/fujimoto-end-end-process-2019-b/","publishdate":"2021-07-03T02:46:27.618636Z","relpermalink":"/publication/fujimoto-end-end-process-2019-b/","section":"publication","summary":"To promote Bio-Energy with Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage (BECCS), which aims to replace fossil fuels with bio energy and store carbon underground, and Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+), which aims to reduce the carbon emissions produced by forest degradation, it is important to build forest management plans based on the scientific prediction of forest dynamics.

However, the unplanned introduction of renewable energies, such as solar power and woody biomass energy, can cause conflicts among energy production, biodiversity, and ecosystem services (BES). In this study, we conducted a scenario analysis of land use management and the selection of renewable energy alternatives to identify such potential conflicts. The case study area was the Bekanbeushi River Watershed in the northeastern Japan. In this watershed, major industries include fishery, forestry, and pasture grass production for dairy farming. However, the population of workers in the primary industry has continuously decreased since 1960. The expansion of abandoned pastureland is considerable issue in this area. In this study, we defined this trend as business as usual scenario. Two alternative scenarios were set to utilize those abandoned pasture lands according to the regional energy plans. One scenario promoted the introduction of the solar power plant on the abandoned pasturelands. The other scenario utilized the production of woody biomass from pioneer species which established on the abandoned pasturelands. The LANDIS-II NECN succession was applied to express the plausible scenarios. And the simulation duration was from 2016 to 2100. The balance of regional energy demand and renewable energy supply, and a habitat suitability index for Blakiston's fish owl, the Satoyama Index were calculated. Moreover, ecosystem services were estimated using the NEE, timber and pasture grass yield, and landscape change.

In Japan, the shrinking and aging population will likely lead to a situation of underuse of natural resources, resulting in rewilding of terrestrial ecosystems. This study conducted a quantitative scenario analysis of natural capital and ESs by linking model and social scenarios on a local scale. The case study area was the Bekanbeushi River Watershed in Northern Japan. LANDIS-II model (a forest landscape model) was used to simulate the vegetation dynamics in species composition, age structure, and biomass considering impacts of forest and pasture land management. Four ``population distribution'' and ``capital preference'' scenarios were translated into forest and pasture land management. The population distribution and capital preference assumptions resulted in different consequences for natural capital and ESs. The population distribution affected the spatial allocation of abandoned pasture land and level of isolation of managed pasture land. The capital preference assumptions largely affected the consequences for ESs. Finally, these simulation results demonstrated the capacity to feed quantitative information to the narrative scenarios. Our process-based approach provides insight into the relationships among social drivers, ecological processes, and the consequences that will affect natural capital and ESs, which can contribute to decision-making and sustainability design of regions, which may face issues associated with underuse in the future.","tags":[],"title":"Simulation of Natural Capital and Ecosystem Services in a Watershed in Northern Japan Focusing on the Future Underuse of Nature: By Linking Forest Landscape Model and Social Scenarios","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Takanori Matsui","Chihiro Haga","Osamu Saito","Shizuka Hashimoto"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1627433728,"objectID":"96990a02f80f8c3e2d41d0d414fa77c4","permalink":"https://hagachi.github.io/publication/matsui-spatially-explicit-residential-2019-b/","publishdate":"2021-07-03T02:46:28.612889Z","relpermalink":"/publication/matsui-spatially-explicit-residential-2019-b/","section":"publication","summary":"In scenario studies of biodiversity and ecosystem services, the population distribution is one of the key driving forces.

Land use and land cover in watershed influence nutrient concentrations and fluxes of stream water. In addition, climate change will affect nutrient leaching to stream water through changes of nutrient cycles in terrestrial ecosystem. However, combined effects of land use / land cover and climate changes on nutrient leaching has not been fully understood. We aimed to understand the relationship between land use / land cover distribution and nitrogen concentrations in stream water in a forest, farmland and wetland dominated landscape where productivity of marine resources in the downstream lake play a key role in the local economy. We also aimed to understand the possible consequences of the future land use / land cover changes and climate change in the watershed in terms of nitrogen supply from terrestrial to aquatic ecosystem.   In Bekanbeushi watershed located in eastern Hokkaido, Japan, we conducted a field survey of stream water quality and GIS analysis to understand the relationship between land use and nitrogen concentrations in stream water. The combined effects of land use land cover change and climate change on nitrogen leaching in the watershed was simulated using forest landscape model, LANDIS-II with NECN extension (Scheller et al. 2011). In the model simulation for 2015-2050, we utilized several scenarios that describe the different combinations of the following changes: abandonment of pasture management, changes in tree species composition in forest plantation, and changes in climate factors (i.e., air temperature and precipitation).  The nitrate concentrations in stream water were higher in the watershed where farmland occupies large proportion compared to the watershed where forest and wetland are the main land cover. The pasture abandonment strongly impact on nitrate leaching compared with the changes in species composition in plantation forest. The amount of nitrate leaching in pasture land was affected by land use change than that by climate change, while opposite was the case in forest. These results suggest that effects of changes in land use and climate were different among land use types. We also found that precipitation change was more responsible for the temporal variation of nitrate leaching in future than temperature rise in all scenarios.  Our findings would help the local community make a decision for more sustainable management and environment conservation in both forest and agricultural land of the landscape level.","tags":[],"title":"Combined Effects of Future Changes Land Use/Cover and Climate on Nitrogen Leaching to Stream Water in a Forest, Farmland and Wetland Dominated Landscape, Northern Japan","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chihiro Haga","Takahiro Inoue","Takanori Matsui","Junko Morimoto","Hideaki Shibata","Takashi Machimura"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1535760000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1691119523,"objectID":"0e31cb86152886e3ae8ca1c53fb665d3","permalink":"https://hagachi.github.io/publication/haga-scenario-analysis-landscape-2018/","publishdate":"2021-09-07T03:37:27.988526Z","relpermalink":"/publication/haga-scenario-analysis-landscape-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"Japanese rural society is shrinking, and depopulation and aging are the critical driving forces of under-use of natural resources.  Abandonment of forest and farmland management cause vegetation succession and alter ecosystem services.  To visualize possible prospects taking the uncertainties of social systems into consideration, a scenario approach is effective. The objective is to simulate the landscape dynamics and to analyze the changes in ecosystem services and landscape diversity under plausible future scenarios in the shrinking rural society.  Bekanbeushi Watershed in northern Japan was selected as a study site where the population is continuously decreasing.  This watershed is one of the representative boreal landscapes composed of forest, farmland, and wetland.  We used four national scale narrative scenarios which consisted of the dimensions of population distribution (urban compactification or dispersed population) and people's preference of consumable capital (natural or produced) developed by the Predicting and Assessing Natural Capital and Ecosystem Services (PANCES) project (http://pances.net/eng/). First, to simulate the changes in forest and farmland management, clear-cutting and thinning intensities (% yr-1) and pasture land abandonment rate (km2 yr-1) from 2015 to 2050 were set based on the scenarios.  Second, landscape dynamics under the forestry practice and the expansion of pasture land abandonment were simulated from 2015 to 2050 using a Forest Landscape Model, LANDIS-II NECN succession extension v4.2.  Finally, the conditions of nature (land cover and aboveground biomass) and ecosystem services (carbon sequestration and timber/grass production) were evaluated. The abandonment of pasture land resulted in the expansion of pioneer species (Betula platyphylla Sukaczev) and increased carbon stock.  The forestry practice also induced a trade-off between carbon sequestration in the watershed and timber production during the simulation period.  These results were used to break down the national narrative scenarios. This study simulated the forest landscape changes considering forestry practices and the farmland abandonment and analyzed impacts on terrestrial ecosystem services and landscape diversity.  This approach has applicability to any changing society and contributes to following conference goals; ``Modelling land system change,'' ``Land use drivers and impacts,'' ``Trade-offs for land use and conflict,'' and ``Land change and ecosystem services/biodiversity.''  Moreover, changes in the land cover and the vegetation dynamics in terrestrial ecosystems impact coastal ecosystems through nutrient leaching. Therefore, the discussions of our results with land-ocean scientists will help to understand the interlinkage and contribute to the session's theme ``Land-ocean connectivity and interactions on ecosystem structures, processes and services.''","tags":[],"title":"Scenario Analysis of Landscape Change and Evaluation of Terrestrial Ecosystem Services and Landscape Diversity Using Forest Landscape Model","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Shizuka Hashimoto","Rajarshi DasGupta","Kei Kabaya","Takanori Matsui","Chihiro Haga","Osamu Saito","Kazuhiko Takeuchi"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1533081600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1627433728,"objectID":"6536bb2be7bcb447b2c046bf34063994","permalink":"https://hagachi.github.io/publication/hashimoto-scenario-analysis-landuse-2018/","publishdate":"2021-07-03T02:46:28.173855Z","relpermalink":"/publication/hashimoto-scenario-analysis-landuse-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"Population-decline and subsequent underuse of social-ecological landscapes are increasingly being recognized as one of the crucial drivers behind the loss and deterioration of biodiversity and ecosystem services. In line with this, the study aimed to explore how alternative development pathways influence future land-use patterns, biodiversity and ecosystem services against a rapidly declining population in the Noto peninsula of Japan. By combining land-use simulation and evaluation of ecosystem services, the study formulated four exploratory scenarios for 2050, assuming a contrasting level of the society's reliance on domestic natural capital and different demographic patterns. At first, we analyzeds historical landuse changes between 1997 and 2007 and thereby simulated four plausible alternative scenarios using the Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Network model. These scenarios were further used to quantify ecosystem services and landscape heterogeneity (as biodiversity indicator). The scenario analysis demonstrated that future land-use pattern could vary drastically depending on how the society utilize local natural capital even under the severe depopulation trend, whereas demographic patterns, in general, did not make discernible differences in land-use, biodiversity and ecosystem services. Nevertheless, a land-use change made considerable differences in the level of ecosystem services and landscape heterogeneity with varying degrees. Our analysis suggested that ecosystem services such as food production and nitrogen retention as well as landscape heterogeneity would decrease considerably by 2050 under the scenarios where the utilization of local natural capital decline and a significant amount of farmland are abandoned. Our findings highlight the vital role of land-use and agricultural policy in shaping the future availability of ecosystem services and biodiversity in this area.","tags":[],"title":"Scenario Analysis of Land-Use and Ecosystem Services of Social-Ecological Landscapes: Implications of Alternative Development Pathways under Declining Population in the Noto Peninsula, Japan","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chihiro Haga","Takahiro Inoue","Wataru Hotta","Rei Shibata","Hiroko Kurokawa","Shizuka Hashimoto","Takashi Machimura","Takanori Matsui","Junko Morimoto","Hideaki Shibata"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1512086400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1630985935,"objectID":"f9bc7e00f37cd371dc907fff4d5ba93e","permalink":"https://hagachi.github.io/publication/haga-development-future-scenario-2017/","publishdate":"2021-09-07T03:37:27.533882Z","relpermalink":"/publication/haga-development-future-scenario-2017/","section":"publication","summary":"Quantitative future scenario analysis of Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (BES) plays the key role in facilitating decision making for sustainable management of landscapes. In Japan, climate change and underuse of natural resources are the critical driving forces of forest degradation. Therefore, to simulate plausible future scenarios under the Japanese societal context by using terrestrial ecosystem models, we need to represent both 1) vegetation response to climate change and 2) impacts on vegetation dynamics caused by management and abandonment. In this study, we developed a scenario simulation system based on LANDIS-II model (a Landscape Change Model). This system can model landscape change process considering with Land-Use and Land-Cover (LULC) change and management of forest and grassland and evaluate BES. We selected Bekanbeushi watershed in Hokkaido prefecture as a representative region where is vulnerable to climate change and underuse. First, we created future scenarios of 2050. The scenarios consisted of climate change scenarios based on RCP2.6 and 8.5 from CMIP5, and management scenarios of timber and pasture production. Regarding climate scenarios, we input monthly climate data in 1 km resolution from statistically downscaled MIROC5 and MRI-CGCM3. Moreover, in association with management scenarios, we translated the qualitative scenarios to quantitative dataframes, and linking them to the input interface of LANDIS-II. We localized LANDIS-II v6.2, NECN succession v4.2, and Biomass Harvest v3.2, and simulated forest succession at 100 m resolution. Finally, we evaluated the expected yields of timber and pasture, carbon stock in the forest and grassland, species composition, and LULC change. The results imply that our simulation system can visualize the plausible future of natural capital in regional scale and quantify the available ecosystem services under different scenarios. This system expected to contribute to decision making and sustainability design for regional scale.","tags":[],"title":"A Development of Future Scenario Simulation System of Natural Capital and Ecosystem Services on LANDIS-II ůle1em1ptLinking Qualitative Scenarios and Landscape Change Model in Japanl̊e1em1pt","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Shizuka Hashimoto","Das Gupta Rajarshi","Kei Kabaya","Takanori Matsui","Chihiro Haga","Osamu Saito","Kazuhiko Takeuchi"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1512086400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1630985935,"objectID":"c68aef22c13014f40c9a5871992f8a43","permalink":"https://hagachi.github.io/publication/hashimoto-exploring-alternative-futures-2017/","publishdate":"2021-09-07T03:37:28.439151Z","relpermalink":"/publication/hashimoto-exploring-alternative-futures-2017/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Exploring Alternative Futures for the Social-Ecological Production Landscapes of Noto: Implications of Land Use Change on the Provision of Ecosystem Services","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chihiro Haga","Ryota Horio","Takanori Matsui","Takashi Machimura"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1506816000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1630985935,"objectID":"6394ac449dd44ef011b2fc94eeb0d94a","permalink":"https://hagachi.github.io/publication/haga-simulation-changes-forest-2017/","publishdate":"2021-09-07T03:37:28.140599Z","relpermalink":"/publication/haga-simulation-changes-forest-2017/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Simulation of Changes in Forest Biomass and Tree Species Composition after Natural Regeneration For Adaptation To Climate Change ůle1em1ptCase Study In Ishikawa Prefecturel̊e1em1pt","type":"publication"},{"authors":["智宏 芳賀","孝典 松井","亮太 堀尾","尚 町村"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1477958400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1630985935,"objectID":"a147b9d4d171472c4dc39edd3e49bfa0","permalink":"https://hagachi.github.io/publication/fanghe-li-shandeno-ren-wei-de-jiao-luanni-banu-zhi-shengno-qian-yito-jing-guanno-duo-yang-xingno-bian-hua-2016/","publishdate":"2021-09-07T03:37:26.637267Z","relpermalink":"/publication/fanghe-li-shandeno-ren-wei-de-jiao-luanni-banu-zhi-shengno-qian-yito-jing-guanno-duo-yang-xingno-bian-hua-2016/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"里山での人為的撹乱に伴う植生の遷移と景観の多様性の変化","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chihiro Haga","Takanori Matsui","Shizuka Hashimoto","Osamu Saito","Takashi Machimura"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1464739200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1630985935,"objectID":"c83cbbb6285b64c31853d57e250832cd","permalink":"https://hagachi.github.io/publication/haga-development-simulation-process-2016-a/","publishdate":"2021-09-07T03:37:27.68674Z","relpermalink":"/publication/haga-development-simulation-process-2016-a/","section":"publication","summary":"The sustainable management of satoyama landscapes should be explored to promote building a society in harmony with nature.
