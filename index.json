This study aimed to estimate the potential availability of waste woody biomass in the Aizu region and its energy potential for local bioelectricity generation as a sustainable strategy. The results showed that the available quantity of forest residual biomass for energy production was 191,065 tons, with an average of 1.385 t/ha in 2018, of which 72% (146,976 tons) was from logging residue for commercial purposes, and 28% (44,089 tons) was from thinning operations for forest management purposes. Forests within the biomass–collection radius of a local woody power plant can provide 45,925 tons of residual biomass, supplying bioelectricity at 1.6 times the plant’s capacity, which could avoid the amount of 65,246 tons of CO2 emission per year by replacing coal-fired power generation. The results highlight the bioelectricity potential and carbon-neutral capacity of residual biomass. This encourages government initiatives or policy inclinations to sustainably boost the production of bioenergy derived from residual biomass.","tags":[],"title":"Estimation of Forest Residual Biomass for Bioelectricity Utilization towards Carbon Neutrality Based on Sentinel-2A Multi-Temporal Images: A Case Study of Aizu Region of Fukushima, Japan","type":"publication"},{"authors":["孝典 松井","舞 渡辺","隼人 今井","智宏 芳賀","増原, 直樹 ","俊 川久保"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1704067200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1735540846,"objectID":"60f151e873ccf870b27f2041d8a693e7","permalink":"https://hagachi.github.io/publication/matsui-psb-47-2024/","publishdate":"2024-12-30T06:40:45.995051Z","relpermalink":"/publication/matsui-psb-47-2024/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"47都道府県のプラネタリー・ソーシャルバウンダリー評価の試行","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Reina Kawase","Mamoru Ichise","Chihiro Haga","Takanori Matsui","Hiroyuki Kusaka"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1704067200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1735540780,"objectID":"4e82f9e881b9322cbe74656b2d44a278","permalink":"https://hagachi.github.io/publication/kawase-study-2024/","publishdate":"2024-12-30T06:40:45.480405Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kawase-study-2024/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"A STUDY ON UNCERTAINTY IN CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACT ASSESSMENT BASED ON ESTIMATION OF THE NUMBER OF TRANSPORTED HEATSTROKE","type":"publication"},{"authors":["芳賀 智宏","増田 惟吹","東出 天舞音","三井 健矢","堀 啓子","松村 悠子","山口 容平","松井 孝典","石濱 史子","臼田 裕一郎","橋本 禅"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1704067200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1735540845,"objectID":"493512ecf9f5aed237e9bd861c5298a6","permalink":"https://hagachi.github.io/publication/haga-solarpv-validation-2024/","publishdate":"2024-12-30T06:40:45.882904Z","relpermalink":"/publication/haga-solarpv-validation-2024/","section":"publication","summary":"脱炭素の実現に向けて保全や地域社会とコンフリクトを生じない太陽光発電の導入を促進する必要がある．本研究では，再生可能エネルギーの導入拡大に向けて，太陽光発電のポテンシャルと実際の導入量の空間分布のギャップを明らかにすることを目的とした．結果からは，全国の発電ポテンシャルがあるメッシュ（500m）の98.5%では導入が進んでいないことが明らかになった．導入済みのメッシュでは，REPOSで推計されたポテンシャルの1.9倍の設備容量が導入されていた．ポテンシャルがゼロと推計されているメッシュに導入された設備容量のうち45.0%は森林を開発して建設されたものであった．考察では今後各地で進む促進区域の設定の際の留意点を議論した．","tags":[],"title":"日本全国の太陽光発電施設と導入ポテンシャルの空間分布のギャップの分析","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1689206400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1691119523,"objectID":"a59dd45f490941a5789195169aa4b9f6","permalink":"https://hagachi.github.io/talk/visualizing-conflicts-between-terrestrial-biodiversity-conservation-renewable-energy-potential-in-japan-poster/","publishdate":"2023-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/visualizing-conflicts-between-terrestrial-biodiversity-conservation-renewable-energy-potential-in-japan-poster/","section":"event","summary":"日本国内の生物多様性保全と再エネポテンシャルのコンフリクトの解析","tags":["nature","direct driver","biodiversity","LANDIS-II"],"title":"Visualizing Conflicts between Terrestrial Biodiversity Conservation \u0026 Renewable Energy Potential in Japan (Poster)","type":"event"},{"authors":["Sintha P.W.

This study developed a protocol with three specifications for operationalizing the Nature Futures Framework (NFF) in a landscape scenario analysis using a multi-objective optimization framework composed of: (1) exploring nature-positive futures, (2) seeking alternative pathways for targets satisfying visions of plural values, and (3) screening key direct drivers to achieve the targets. This research conducted a case study of a rural landscape in northeastern Japan. First, 110 strategies of landscape management options were simulated from 2015 to 2100 using a forest landscape model, LANDIS-II. The simulation developed a data frame of four integrated indicators of the NFF values for each year and strategy. Second, nature-positive strategies were screened using the common values. Pareto optimal strategies were then identified to obtain equally good solutions. Finally, the key response options to achieve good nature-positive futures were identified using decision tree analysis. Our protocol identified (1) multiple, but few nature-positive and Pareto optimal strategies that satisfied NFF visions, (2) nature-positive, but not Pareto optimal strategies, and (3) non-nature-positive strategies. In most Pareto optimal strategies, the maximized value perspectives changed over time. Our protocol also identified key response options to achieve three different NFF value perspectives in the case study area: (1) clear or selective cutting in forestry and (2) solar PV installation on abandoned pastureland in agriculture and energy sectors. We discussed the implication for local landscape management, localizing NFF narratives to develop future scenarios and modeling practice of NFF. The protocol does not depend on a specific model and indicator. Thus, our scalable protocol can be applied to scenarios and model practices in any region to support envisioning plausible, feasible, and positive futures, and designing future stakeholder collaboration.","tags":["Scenario analysis","Forest landscape model","Forestry","Agriculture","Nature positive"],"title":"Modeling desirable futures at local scale by combining the nature futures framework and multi-objective optimization","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zhiwei Liu","Ryusei Saito","Jing Guo","Chizuko Hirai","Chihiro Haga","Takanori Matsui","Hiroaki Shirakawa","Hiroki Tanikawa"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1678147200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1691052796,"objectID":"5514fbfe5a8f6649d033b7b2880d0a5f","permalink":"https://hagachi.github.io/publication/liu-does-2023/","publishdate":"2023-08-03T08:29:26.67651Z","relpermalink":"/publication/liu-does-2023/","section":"publication","summary":"Built environment stocks have attracted much attention in recent decades because of their role in material and energy flows and environmental impacts. Spatially refined estimation of built environment stocks benefits city management, for example, in urban mining and resource circularity strategy making. Nighttime light (NTL) data sets are widely used and are regarded as high-resolution products in large-scale building stock research. However, some of their limitations, especially blooming/saturation effects, have hampered performance in estimating building stocks. In this study, we experimentally proposed and trained a convolution neural network (CNN)-based building stock estimation (CBuiSE) model and applied it to major Japanese metropolitan areas to estimate building stocks using NTL data. The results show that the CBuiSE model is capable of estimating building stocks at a relatively high resolution (approximately 830 m) and reflecting spatial distribution patterns, although the accuracy needs to be further improved to enhance the model performance. In addition, the CBuiSE model can effectively mitigate the overestimation of building stocks arising from the blooming effect of NTL. This study highlights the potential of NTL to provide a new research direction and serve as a cornerstone for future anthropogenic stock studies in the fields of sustainability and industrial ecology.","tags":[],"title":"Does Deep Learning Enhance the Estimation for Spatially Explicit Built Environment Stocks through Nighttime Light Data Set?

Thus, post-windthrow management, which can enhance tree recovery in wind-disturbed forests with dense understory species, is essential for sus­ tainable forest management to adapt to climate change. This study explores management options that can recover the above-ground biomass (AGB) and tree species composition after windthrow damage even under climate change. A case study area was established in the Oshima– Hiyama National Forest in southern Hokkaido, northern Japan, which were damaged by typhoons in late August 2016. We incorporated the understory species Sasa kurilensis as understory vegetation into the LANDIS-II Net Ecosystem Carbon and Nitrogen Succession extension v6.3 model to simulate the outcome of tree establishment under climate change. AGB recovery up to the year 2100 at 1,753 damaged grid cells was simulated for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change representative concentration pathway (RCP) 2.6 and 8.5 scenarios. Different post-windthrow management cases were designed by varying the treatment of fallen trees and the types of trees planted. The results demonstrated that salvage logging and planting successfully recovered the AGB by 2050 at the landscape scale regardless of the climate change scenario, whereas leaving fallen trees in the damaged site or salvage logging only did not facilitate the recovery of AGB. Leaving fallen trees in damaged grid cells as ecological legacies recovered the AGB only in damaged grid cells with a sufficient number of advanced seedlings of adequate types of species irre­ spective of the climate change scenario. The decreasing water equivalent of snowpack in the RCP scenarios caused Sasa kurilensis mortality and promoted the recovery of AGB of trees. The dominant species recovered in natural forests, which experienced either salvage logging or leaving trees in the damaged site, varied among climate change scenarios. The warmer climate condition facilitated the recovery of Fagus crenata by 2100. These results can help designing a robust forest recovery even in uncertain future climate.","tags":[],"title":"Modeling Tree Recovery in Wind-Disturbed Forests with Dense Understory Species under Climate Change","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1663891200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1691119523,"objectID":"b102855c26af35172fd8e0c30106bc4c","permalink":"https://hagachi.github.io/talk/oral-presentation-%E7%94%9F%E7%89%A9%E5%A4%9A%E6%A7%98%E6%80%A7%E3%82%92%E8%80%83%E3%81%88%E3%82%8B/","publishdate":"2022-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/oral-presentation-%E7%94%9F%E7%89%A9%E5%A4%9A%E6%A7%98%E6%80%A7%E3%82%92%E8%80%83%E3%81%88%E3%82%8B/","section":"event","summary":"市民向けワークショップ","tags":["nature","biodiversity"],"title":"Oral Presentation \"生物多様性を考える\"","type":"event"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1656460800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1691119523,"objectID":"b99cda7db228b0915034acad080d9de1","permalink":"https://hagachi.github.io/talk/online-oral-presentation-modelling-a-landscape-using-nature-futures-framework.-a-case-study-in-japan/","publishdate":"2022-06-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/online-oral-presentation-modelling-a-landscape-using-nature-futures-framework.-a-case-study-in-japan/","section":"event","summary":"Nature Futures Frameworkを応用したシナリオ分析事例紹介","tags":["nature","direct driver","biodiversity","LANDIS-II"],"title":"Online Oral Presentation \"Modelling a landscape using nature futures framework. a case study in japan\"","type":"event"},{"authors":["Kentaro Tanaka","Chihiro Haga","Keiko Hori","Takanori Matsui"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1648771200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1691119523,"objectID":"e613ad81a9314bf2590b06d7ee6f8d03","permalink":"https://hagachi.github.io/publication/tanaka-renewable-energy-nexus-2022/","publishdate":"2022-04-25T09:31:43.00181Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tanaka-renewable-energy-nexus-2022/","section":"publication","summary":"Renewable energy is one of the most important sources of energy for a decarbonized future. The use of renewable energy necessitates the thorough study of interlinkages with social issues such as the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, there are no high-resolution renewable energy datasets for analyzing interlinkages. The goal of this research is to 1) create a high-resolution geographically explicit renewable energy potential map, 2) evaluate the SDGs nexus using the potential map, 3) discuss the improvement of renewable energy dataset, and 4) discuss nexus issues for implementing renewable energy systems in Japan. Our potential map has the same resolution of 500 m and unit of annual electricity generation on each energy. The occurence of endangered birds was overlapping with the area having a lot of solar energy potential. Local renewable energy is difficult to access on a small spatial scale, especially in urban regions like Tokyo. Our potential map can be used as a database for site selection and area zoning. The findings suggest that implementing decentralized renewable energy systems in today's highly concentrated megacities, such as the Tokyo Metropolitan Area, is extremely challenging, and that this type of centralized-oriented land design is likely to exacerbate the problem of energy poverty.","tags":["\"decision support\"","\"endangered birds\"","\"energy access\"","\"energy poverty\"","\"renewable energy map\"","nexus"],"title":"Renewable Energy Nexus: Interlinkages with Biodiversity and Social Issues in Japan","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1647302400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1691119523,"objectID":"8ac1b5f35938ebc64f02a6477aaec9d2","permalink":"https://hagachi.github.io/talk/online-poster-%E5%9C%B0%E6%96%B9%E8%87%AA%E6%B2%BB%E4%BD%93%E3%82%B9%E3%82%B1%E3%83%BC%E3%83%AB%E3%81%A6%E3%81%AE%E6%A3%AE%E6%9E%97%E5%8B%95%E6%85%8B%E3%83%A2%E3%83%86%E3%83%AA%E3%83%B3%E3%82%AF/","publishdate":"2022-03-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/online-poster-%E5%9C%B0%E6%96%B9%E8%87%AA%E6%B2%BB%E4%BD%93%E3%82%B9%E3%82%B1%E3%83%BC%E3%83%AB%E3%81%A6%E3%81%AE%E6%A3%AE%E6%9E%97%E5%8B%95%E6%85%8B%E3%83%A2%E3%83%86%E3%83%AA%E3%83%B3%E3%82%AF/","section":"event","summary":"森林簿の検証とRSデータを用いた森林動態モデリングの検討","tags":["nature","biodiversity","LANDIS-II"],"title":"Online Poster \"地方自治体スケールでの森林動態モデリング\"","type":"event"},{"authors":["Xiangyun Shi","Takanori Matsui","Takashi Machimura","Chihiro Haga","Ang Hu","Xiaoyu Gan"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1643673600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1642315208,"objectID":"2f50e79909565da7627c7b4d882bb5c4","permalink":"https://hagachi.github.io/publication/shi-impact-urbanization-food-2022/","publishdate":"2022-01-16T06:33:47.916043Z","relpermalink":"/publication/shi-impact-urbanization-food-2022/","section":"publication","summary":"The food– water– land– ecosystem (FWLE) nexus is fundamental for achieving sustainable development. This study examines the influence of urbanization on the FWLE nexus. Toward this end, land was deemed as an entry point. Therefore, the impact of urbanization on the nexus was explored based on changes in land use. We selected Shenzhen, a city in China, as the study area. First, a land change modeler was employed to analyze historical land-use changes from 2000 to 2010, to build transition potential submodels, and to project future land-use patterns for 2030 under a business-as-usual scenario. Second, based on land-use maps, we assessed habitat quality, water yield, and water supply from 2000 to 2030 using Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs. Moreover, crop production was estimated according to statistical materials. Finally, the study presents the analyses and discussion of the impacts of urbanization on ecosystem services related to the FWLE nexus. The results of land-use changes indicated that a significant expansion of artificial surfaces occurred in Shenzhen with varying degrees of decrease in cultivated land, forest, and grassland. Furthermore, habitat quality, water supply, and crop production decreased evidently due to rapid urbanization. In contrast, the total water yield indicated an upward trend owing to the increased water yield from increasing artificial surfaces, whereas water yield from other land-use areas declined, such as the forest and grassland. The results demonstrated a significant positive correlation between artificial surfaces and total water yield. However, negative correlations were observed in the interaction among habitat quality, water supply, and crop production. The study presented temporal and spatial assessments to provide an effective and convenient means of exploring the interactions and tradeoffs within the FWLE nexus, which, thus, contributed to the sustainable transformation of urbanization.","tags":["\"Ecosystem services\"","\"Food–water–land–ecosystem nexus\"","\"InVEST\"","\"Land-use changes\"","\"Urbanization\""],"title":"Impact of Urbanization on the Food– Water– Land– Ecosystem Nexus: A Study of Shenzhen, China","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jaegyu Kim","Takashi Iwakawa","Michinori Kimura","Takanori Matsui","Osamu Saito","Keiko Hori","Chihiro Haga"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1638316800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1642315208,"objectID":"817610f3492f0b95d09b2af328ba87cd","permalink":"https://hagachi.github.io/publication/kim-evaluation-energy-utilization-2021/","publishdate":"2022-01-16T06:33:47.411244Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kim-evaluation-energy-utilization-2021/","section":"publication","summary":"Targeting Shiga Prefecture, the study proposed energy utilization scenarios for wood biomass as a nature-based solution (NbS) toward the realization of a zero-carbon society. the study evaluated to quantify co-benefits for the environment, economy and society through implementation of NbS.

Although the short-term effects of post-windthrow management have been well studied, we do not have enough knowledge about the long-term effects of post-windthrow management on species composition and biomass recovery. Those effects associated with an increase in the windthrow frequency are also unknown. Although forest landscape models can effectively evaluate these effects, conventional models do not represent the regeneration process on downed logs, which is essential for simulating forest succession. We focused on hemiboreal forests in northern Japan and aimed to (1) incorporate the regeneration process on downed logs into LANDIS-II, which is one of the most used forest landscape models; (2) evaluate the long-term effects of post-windthrow management on tree species composition and aboveground biomass recovery; and (3) evaluate the associated long-term effects of interactions between post-windthrow management and increased windthrow frequency. We incorporated the regeneration process on downed logs into LANDIS-II by regulating the probability of the establishment of species that depend on dead wood, such as spruce, according to the availability of well-decayed dead wood. The incorporation of this process resulted in simulations of trends in species composition and aboveground biomass recovery after post-windthrow management that were more accurate than those produced by the original model. In the modified LANDIS-II simulation, reductions in dead wood and advanced seedlings due to salvage logging had little effect on the tree species composition or aboveground biomass recovery; however, the complete destruction of advanced seedlings by scarification induced a delay in aboveground biomass recovery and a shift to birch-dominated forests that continued for 100~years. In addition, the reduction in dead wood due to salvage logging decreased the number of seedlings, especially of dead wood-dependent species, that established after windthrow. When the windthrow frequency doubled, this decrease in seedlings induced a delay in aboveground biomass recovery, and a substantial decrease in dead wood-dependent species biomass occurred after a subsequent windthrow event. However, after the second windthrow event and following scarification, the forest recovered in the same way as after the first windthrow because the destruction of advanced seedlings and understory plants, namely, dwarf bamboo (Sasa spp.), by scarification reset the site conditions. To conserve the species composition and aboveground biomass of hemiboreal forests under climate change, which is expected to increase windthrow frequency, salvage logging and scarification should be avoided.","tags":["\"Decayed downed logs\"","\"Forest landscape model\"","\"LANDIS-II\"","\"Regeneration\"","\"Salvage logging\"","\"Scarification\""],"title":"Long-Term Cumulative Impacts of Windthrow and Subsequent Management on Tree Species Composition and Aboveground Biomass: A Simulation Study Considering Regeneration on Downed Logs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kataoka Yuta","Chihiro Haga","Takanori Matsui","Takashi Machimura","Kenji Tsuruta","Michinori Kimura"],"categories":["scenario analysis","flm"],"content":"","date":1638316800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1642315208,"objectID":"a2aa4abd35f0a4b8eced8dd6a2d7bbe2","permalink":"https://hagachi.github.io/publication/yuta-modeling-synergies-trade-offs-2021/","publishdate":"2022-01-16T06:33:48.083399Z","relpermalink":"/publication/yuta-modeling-synergies-trade-offs-2021/","section":"publication","summary":"For realizing RCES (Regional Circular and Ecological Sphere), it is essential to manage forest from a sustainable and multifaceted perspective that can simultaneously achieve the multiple goals of the SDGs.

Recent traffic emission changes under the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic have been estimated using emerging non-fuel consumption data, such as human mobility data that tech companies reported as AD, due to the unavailability of timely fuel statistics. The use of such unconventional activity data (UAD) might allow us to provide emission estimates in near-real time; however, the errors and uncertainties associated with such estimates are expected to be larger than those of common FFCO2 inventory estimates, and thus should be provided along with a thorough evaluation/validation of the methodology and the resulting estimates. Here, we show the impact of COVID-19 on traffic CO2 emissions over the first six months of 2020 in Japan. We calculated CO2 monthly emissions using fuel consumption data and assessed the emission changes relative to 2019. Regardless of Japan's soft approach to COVID-19, traffic emissions significantly declined by 23.8% during the state of emergency in Japan (April– May). We also compared relative emission changes among different estimates available. Our analysis suggests that UAD-based emission estimates during April and May could be biased by -19.6% to 12.6%. We also used traffic count data for examining the performance of UAD as a proxy for traffic and/or CO2 emissions. We found the assumed proportional relationship between traffic changes and CO2 emissions was not enough for estimating emissions with accuracy, and moreover, the traffic-based approach failed to capture emission seasonality. Our study highlighted the challenges and difficulties in repurposing data, especially ones with limited traceability/reproducibility, for modeling human activities and assessing the impact on the environment, and the importance of a thorough error and uncertainty assessment before using these data in policy applications.","tags":[],"title":"Errors and Uncertainties Associated with the Use of Unconventional Activity Data for Estimating CO2 Emissions: The Case for Traffic Emissions in Japan","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1627257600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1627296012,"objectID":"5773a25ad835221e33c514d72852196f","permalink":"https://hagachi.github.io/talk/short-talk-at-public-online-symposium-of-ecological-society-of-japan-mainstreaming-renewable-energy-in-decade-of-action-requires-ecologists/","publishdate":"2021-07-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/short-talk-at-public-online-symposium-of-ecological-society-of-japan-mainstreaming-renewable-energy-in-decade-of-action-requires-ecologists/","section":"event","summary":"Mainstreaming renewable energy in decade of action requires ecologists","tags":["biodiversity","renewable energy"],"title":"Short talk at Public Online Symposium of Ecological Society of Japan \"Mainstreaming renewable energy in decade of action requires ecologists\"","type":"event"},{"authors":["Xiangyun Shi","Takanori Matsui","Chihiro Haga","Takashi Machimura","Shizuka Hashimoto","Osamu Saito"],"categories":["scenario analysis"],"content":"","date":1625097600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1627433728,"objectID":"c05e96397de7acf67fecd005f7ab1ced","permalink":"https://hagachi.github.io/publication/shi-scenario-spatialdownscalingbased-landuse-2021/","publishdate":"2021-07-28T00:42:49.090102Z","relpermalink":"/publication/shi-scenario-spatialdownscalingbased-landuse-2021/","section":"publication","summary":"Land-use change is a crucial driver for achieving a sustainable future.

Second, future projections were made for the ``business-as-usual'' scenario and five localized SSP scenarios that were downscaled from global scenarios and modified based on the local land planning policy. Hong Kong was considered a typical case in the Greater Bay Area that could be used to demonstrate the application of the projected land-use maps by comparing the biocapacity and ecological footprint and estimating the carbon emissions associated with land use. The results of the future projections of land use made under six future scenarios indicated that there is a significant expansion in the urban area under all the scenarios, with varying degrees of decrease in cropland and forest among the different scenarios. Moreover, a land-use change also led to the change in local biocapacity and carbon emissions. Our analysis indicated that in achieving sustainable development not only urban area and cropland should be involved for consideration but should also cover the balance between all land-use classes, and three policy implications were proposed based on our findings.","tags":["scenario analysis","biodiversity","ecosystem services","shared socioeconomic pathway"],"title":"A Scenario- and Spatial-Downscaling-Based Land-Use Modeling Framework to Improve the Projections of Plausible Futures: A Case Study of the Guangdong–Hong Kong–Macao Greater Bay Area, China","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Keigo Kobayashi","Keisuke Masuda","Chihiro Haga","Takanori Matsui","Dai Fukui","Takashi Machimura"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1619827200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1691119523,"objectID":"f08247049d8b3e95457297cbb0a3f48c","permalink":"https://hagachi.github.io/publication/kobayashi-development-species-identification-2021-a/","publishdate":"2021-07-03T02:46:28.32846Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kobayashi-development-species-identification-2021-a/","section":"publication","summary":"Bats inhabit all continents except Antarctica, and they have enormous potential as bioindicators. Therefore, monitoring bats helps us to understand the surrounding environmental changes. However, bats are nocturnal, which makes it difficult to visually monitor their behavior. This paper proposes a bat species identifier method based on the analysis of ultrasound called echolocation calls, which is a promising method to monitor bats' activity levels effectively. We develop a robust method to identify the bat species with improved accuracy by analyzing their echolocation calls. First, 1400 sound files with four families, 13 genera, and 30 species were recorded in Japan and the Jincheon-gun in South Korea from 1999 to 2019. Bat echolocation calls were detected from the sound files and used to generate 54,525 spectrograms by applying short-time Fourier transform. We developed a deep learning– based bat species identifier using convolutional neural networks with MobileNetV1 used as the model's architecture. Furthermore, we applied nested cross-validation with the Bayesian optimization algorithm to search for the optimal combination of hyperparameters and evaluate the expected performance. We achieved 98.1% accuracy, which outperformed previous studies that treated more than 30 bat species. We visualized important regions of the spectrograms which correspond to prediction using the Guided Grad-CAM. Moreover, we discussed how to treat the noise class and minimize the model training time. Then, we proposed potential solutions to boost the identifier's performance, the generalization of the echolocation call recording protocols, and applicable techniques to improve the identification accuracy. Future perspectives are 1) to change the deep learning algorithm from image classification to object detection and 2) to apply the proposed identifier to unknown bat echolocation calls to evaluate the feasibility of estimating bat fauna and spatial activity distribution.","tags":["\"Acoustic monitoring\"","\"Convolutional neural networks\"","\"Echolocation call\"","\"Guided Grad-CAM\"","\"Identification\""],"title":"Development of a Species Identification System of Japanese Bats from Echolocation Calls Using Convolutional Neural Networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1618272000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1625386194,"objectID":"2d2950ccdd7c92be9d33fa3706171679","permalink":"https://hagachi.github.io/talk/invited-talk-at-icss/","publishdate":"2021-04-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/invited-talk-at-icss/","section":"event","summary":"PANCES scenario case study in Japan","tags":["biodiversity","LANDIS-II"],"title":"Invited talk at ICSS","type":"event"},{"authors":["Yuko Maegawa","Yuji Ushigome","Masato Suzuki","Karen Taguchi","Keigo Kobayashi","Chihiro Haga","Takanori Matsui"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1614556800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1691119523,"objectID":"b0b3e4ee5ba158ee3c8b87d60a566a4f","permalink":"https://hagachi.github.io/publication/maegawa-new-survey-method-2021/","publishdate":"2021-07-03T02:46:28.471683Z","relpermalink":"/publication/maegawa-new-survey-method-2021/","section":"publication","summary":"Habitat and reproduction surveys of raptors are common components of environmental impact assessments. Raptors are few in number and widely dispersed; therefore, raptor surveys require greater survey frequency compared to surveys for many other bird species, which, in turn, may result in extra costs as well as negative impact on raptors caused by observers. In this research, we propose a new, efficient, method for surveying raptors which is low-impact on the raptors themselves. The target species of this study was the Northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis), categorized as ``Near Threatened'' in the Japanese Red List, its population estimated at 5010– 8950 in 2008. We developed a system which can automatically classify five classes of sounds, including goshawk calls, using a convolutional neural network. To establish the system's applicability as a survey method, we then additionally verified three factors; (1) applicability of the method in different locales, (2) optimal distance from the nest to recording device, and (3) the ability to gauge reproductive states. We report an overall accuracy of 97.0% for this system. This system could classify, with high accuracy, goshawk calls ``kek-kek-kek'' and ``whee-oo'' across different locales. This system could classify sounds collected by recorders placed far from nests and within the forest, not placed on the nest itself. Some limitations of the system, notably limitation in data for verification, remain to be improved through further studies. This survey method can be used to judge whether an area was inhabited by goshawks or not, and their approximate reproductive state, based on a three-hour recording of environmental sounds, with required fieldwork limited to the placing and collection of recorders, and minimal additional human input, due to the system classifying the sounds automatically.","tags":["\"Bird call classification\"","\"Bird call detection\"","\"Convolutional neural network (CNN)\"","\"Monitoring\"","\"Northern goshawk\"","\"Raptor surveys\""],"title":"A New Survey Method Using Convolutional Neural Networks for Automatic Classification of Bird Calls","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Junko Morimoto","Masahiro Aiba","Flavio Furukawa","Yoshio Mishima","Nobuhiko Yoshimura","Sridhara Nayak","Tetsuya Takemi","Haga Chihiro","Takanori Matsui","Futoshi Nakamura"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1627433728,"objectID":"36abe225963456e3f37cba2b00de7239","permalink":"https://hagachi.github.io/publication/morimoto-risk-assessment-forest-2021-a/","publishdate":"2021-07-03T02:46:28.74781Z","relpermalink":"/publication/morimoto-risk-assessment-forest-2021-a/","section":"publication","summary":"Under future climate regimes, the risk of typhoons accompanied by heavy rains is expected to increase. Although the risk of disturbance to forest stands by strong winds has long been of interest, we have little knowledge of how the process is mediated by storms and precipitation. Using machine learning, we assess the disturbance risk to cool-temperate forests by typhoons that landed in northern Japan in late August 2016 to determine the features of damage caused by typhoons accompanied by heavy precipitation, discuss how the process is mediated by precipitation as inferred from the modelling results, and delineate the effective solutions for forest management to decrease the future risk in silviculture. In the results, we confirmed two types of behaviours in the model: one represents the same process as that of forest disturbance by strong wind, which has been widely studied, and another represents a unique process mediated by storms and precipitation that has not been previously investigated. Specifically, the ridges that received strong wind from the front side had the highest risk of disturbance. Precipitation increased the probability of disturbance in forest stands, and its effect was dependent on the dominant species composition. Our hypothesis regarding treefall mediated by storms and precipitation is that rainwater flows into the gaps around the tree root systems during sway and the introduction of rainwater below the root-soil plate decreases the root anchorage. The species-specific vulnerability to rainfall may depend on the volume of lateral roots. Modelling the disturbance risk helped us to examine the kinds of factors that were related to exposure and vulnerability that should be managed to effectively decrease the risk of disturbance by typhoons during future uncontrollable hazards. It is recommended to avoid silviculture on the ridges of plateaus considering the high risk estimated in this area. In addition, species with dense lateral roots would be suitable for planting because they may have high resistance to typhoons with heavy precipitation.","tags":["\"Climate change\"","\"Forest structure\"","\"Risk assessment\"","\"Topography\"","\"Total precipitation\"","\"Windthrow\""],"title":"Risk Assessment of Forest Disturbance by Typhoons with Heavy Precipitation in Northern Japan","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Haga, Chihiro","吳恩達"],"categories":["Demo","教程"],"content":"Overview The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.

However, the poorly designed introduction of RE can cause conflicts between energy production and biodiversity conservation. This study conducted a scenario analysis to evaluate potential conflicts in the nexuses between energy and biodiversity for a case study area, the Bekambeushi River watershed located in northeastern Japan. The increasing rate of pastureland abandonment resulting from a decreasing farmer population is a source of great uncertainty in this area. Two alternative sources of RE were selected to utilize these abandoned pasturelands, each taking a contrasting approach to meet targets stipulated by regional energy plans, thereby implying different ecological consequences at the landscape level. Thirty-one RE introduction cases were simulated, comprising a range of pastureland abandonment expansion speeds and ratios of solar photovoltaic (PV) plant installation to biomass energy use. These were superimposed using two IPCC representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios, 2.6 and 8.5, resulting in 62 cases that were summarized as three scenarios based on the RE supply– demand balance and the ecological impacts. The LANDIS-II model was used to simulate these scenarios from 2016 to 2100. The results indicate that both the rate of pastureland abandonment and the ratio of the two RE sources had a large impact on changes in tree species diversity and the habitat suitability of raptorial birds. Abandoned pastureland converted to tree biomass energy production shifted to pioneer species-dominated forest. The plant species composition of transitional forests varied between the climate scenarios. The higher temperature of the RCP 8.5 scenario toward 2100 prevented the establishment of Betula platyphylla and altered tree species diversity and the habitat suitability of Ketupa blakistoni blakistoni. Biomass energy utilization produced less energy than the demand but increased the three ecological indicators. Solar PV systems provided more energy than the regional demand, but the three ecological indicators decreased. However, an appropriate mixture of the two RE sources satisfied the regional energy demand and maintained ecological conditions. Our results suggest that land– energy planning should consider energy– biodiversity nexuses to a strike balance between decarbonization and biodiversity conservation.","tags":["\"Climate Change\"","\"Farmland abandonment\"","\"LANDIS-II\"","\"Renewable energy mix\"","\"Solar Power Generation\"","\"woody biomass energy\""],"title":"Scenario Analysis of Renewable Energy–Biodiversity Nexuses Using a Forest Landscape Model","type":"publication"},{"authors":["啓子 堀","智宏 芳賀","孝典 松井","修 齊藤","禅 橋本","丈人 吉田","琬惠 黄","惇也 熊谷","美保子 若松","俊介 馬奈木"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1630985935,"objectID":"bd09683f72f10066eb951b3f54fdc104","permalink":"https://hagachi.github.io/publication/ku-yi-zhu-yi-xiangto-guan-xi-ren-kouni-guansuru-shi-tai-diao-chato-guan-xi-ren-kouno-du-dao-fu-xian-bie-tui-ji-2020/","publishdate":"2021-09-07T03:37:28.737284Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ku-yi-zhu-yi-xiangto-guan-xi-ren-kouni-guansuru-shi-tai-diao-chato-guan-xi-ren-kouno-du-dao-fu-xian-bie-tui-ji-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["\"dual residence\"","\"estimation of related population\"","\"migration\"","\"related population\"","\"social survey\""],"title":"移住意向と関係人口に関する実態調査と関係人口の都道府県別推計","type":"publication"},{"authors":["隆成 齋藤","千津子 平井","智宏 芳賀","孝典 松井","博章 白川","寛樹 谷川"],"categories":["ai tech"],"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1630985935,"objectID":"b793ed18dce897836a9393b0db07fee0","permalink":"https://hagachi.github.io/publication/zhaiteng-wei-xing-ye-jian-guang-qing-baoni-jiduku-shen-ceng-xue-xiniyoru-jian-zhu-wuno-yan-chuang-mian-ji-tui-jini-guansuru-yan-jiu-2020/","publishdate":"2021-09-07T03:37:29.510346Z","relpermalink":"/publication/zhaiteng-wei-xing-ye-jian-guang-qing-baoni-jiduku-shen-ceng-xue-xiniyoru-jian-zhu-wuno-yan-chuang-mian-ji-tui-jini-guansuru-yan-jiu-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["\"Deep Learning\"","\"Material Stock and Flow Analysis\"","\"Nighttime Light data\"","\"Remote Sensing\""],"title":"衛星夜間光情報に基づく深層学習による建築物の延床面積推計に関する研究","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ayana Fujimoto","Chihiro Haga","Takanori Matsui","Takashi Machimura","Kiichiro Hayashi","Satoru Sugita","Hiroaki Takagi"],"categories":["flm","ai tech"],"content":"","date":1564617600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1627433728,"objectID":"7b0a24eaf469b70c8c92eb9f3e028006","permalink":"https://hagachi.github.io/publication/fujimoto-end-end-process-2019-b/","publishdate":"2021-07-03T02:46:27.618636Z","relpermalink":"/publication/fujimoto-end-end-process-2019-b/","section":"publication","summary":"To promote Bio-Energy with Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage (BECCS), which aims to replace fossil fuels with bio energy and store carbon underground, and Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+), which aims to reduce the carbon emissions produced by forest degradation, it is important to build forest management plans based on the scientific prediction of forest dynamics.

LANDIS-II model (a forest landscape model) was used to simulate the vegetation dynamics in species composition, age structure, and biomass considering impacts of forest and pasture land management. Four ``population distribution'' and ``capital preference'' scenarios were translated into forest and pasture land management. The population distribution and capital preference assumptions resulted in different consequences for natural capital and ESs. The population distribution affected the spatial allocation of abandoned pasture land and level of isolation of managed pasture land. The capital preference assumptions largely affected the consequences for ESs. Finally, these simulation results demonstrated the capacity to feed quantitative information to the narrative scenarios.

In line with this, the study aimed to explore how alternative development pathways influence future land-use patterns, biodiversity and ecosystem services against a rapidly declining population in the Noto peninsula of Japan. By combining land-use simulation and evaluation of ecosystem services, the study formulated four exploratory scenarios for 2050, assuming a contrasting level of the society's reliance on domestic natural capital and different demographic patterns. At first, we analyzeds historical landuse changes between 1997 and 2007 and thereby simulated four plausible alternative scenarios using the Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Network model. These scenarios were further used to quantify ecosystem services and landscape heterogeneity (as biodiversity indicator). The scenario analysis demonstrated that future land-use pattern could vary drastically depending on how the society utilize local natural capital even under the severe depopulation trend, whereas demographic patterns, in general, did not make discernible differences in land-use, biodiversity and ecosystem services. Nevertheless, a land-use change made considerable differences in the level of ecosystem services and landscape heterogeneity with varying degrees. Our analysis suggested that ecosystem services such as food production and nitrogen retention as well as landscape heterogeneity would decrease considerably by 2050 under the scenarios where the utilization of local natural capital decline and a significant amount of farmland are abandoned. Our findings highlight the vital role of land-use and agricultural policy in shaping the future availability of ecosystem services and biodiversity in this area.","tags":[],"title":"Scenario Analysis of Land-Use and Ecosystem Services of Social-Ecological Landscapes: Implications of Alternative Development Pathways under Declining Population in the Noto Peninsula, Japan","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chihiro Haga","Takanori Matsui","Takashi Machimura"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1691119523,"objectID":"b13732fd949747dc9aed38fc9c5a6a81","permalink":"https://hagachi.github.io/publication/haga-development-simulation-process-2016/","publishdate":"2021-07-03T02:46:27.747573Z","relpermalink":"/publication/haga-development-simulation-process-2016/","section":"publication","summary":"The sustainable management of Satoyama landscape is a major to realize a society in harmony with nature.
