Therefore, monitoring bats helps us to understand the surrounding environmental changes. However, bats are nocturnal, which makes it difficult to visually monitor their behavior. This paper proposes a bat species identifier method based on the analysis of ultrasound called echolocation calls, which is a promising method to monitor bats' activity levels effectively. We develop a robust method to identify the bat species with improved accuracy by analyzing their echolocation calls. First, 1400 sound files with four families, 13 genera, and 30 species were recorded in Japan and the Jincheon-gun in South Korea from 1999 to 2019. Bat echolocation calls were detected from the sound files and used to generate 54,525 spectrograms by applying short-time Fourier transform. We developed a deep learning– based bat species identifier using convolutional neural networks with MobileNetV1 used as the model's architecture. Furthermore, we applied nested cross-validation with the Bayesian optimization algorithm to search for the optimal combination of hyperparameters and evaluate the expected performance. We achieved 98.1% accuracy, which outperformed previous studies that treated more than 30 bat species. We visualized important regions of the spectrograms which correspond to prediction using the Guided Grad-CAM. Moreover, we discussed how to treat the noise class and minimize the model training time. Then, we proposed potential solutions to boost the identifier's performance, the generalization of the echolocation call recording protocols, and applicable techniques to improve the identification accuracy. Future perspectives are 1) to change the deep learning algorithm from image classification to object detection and 2) to apply the proposed identifier to unknown bat echolocation calls to evaluate the feasibility of estimating bat fauna and spatial activity distribution.","tags":["\"Acoustic monitoring\"","\"Convolutional neural networks\"","\"Echolocation call\"","\"Guided Grad-CAM\"","\"Identification\""],"title":"Development of a Species Identification System of Japanese Bats from Echolocation Calls Using Convolutional Neural Networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":" Click on the Slides button above to view the built-in slides feature.   -- ","date":1618272000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1625386194,"objectID":"2d2950ccdd7c92be9d33fa3706171679","permalink":"https://hagachi.github.io/talk/invited-talk-at-icss/","publishdate":"2021-04-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/invited-talk-at-icss/","section":"event","summary":"PANCES scenario case study in Japan","tags":["biodiversity","LANDIS-II"],"title":"Invited talk at ICSS","type":"event"},{"authors":["Yuko Maegawa","Yuji Ushigome","Masato Suzuki","Karen Taguchi","Keigo Kobayashi","Chihiro Haga","Takanori Matsui"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1614556800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1625386194,"objectID":"b0b3e4ee5ba158ee3c8b87d60a566a4f","permalink":"https://hagachi.github.io/publication/maegawa-new-survey-method-2021/","publishdate":"2021-07-03T02:46:28.471683Z","relpermalink":"/publication/maegawa-new-survey-method-2021/","section":"publication","summary":"Habitat and reproduction surveys of raptors are common components of environmental impact assessments. Raptors are few in number and widely dispersed; therefore, raptor surveys require greater survey frequency compared to surveys for many other bird species, which, in turn, may result in extra costs as well as negative impact on raptors caused by observers. In this research, we propose a new, efficient, method for surveying raptors which is low-impact on the raptors themselves. The target species of this study was the Northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis), categorized as ``Near Threatened'' in the Japanese Red List, its population estimated at 5010– 8950 in 2008. We developed a system which can automatically classify five classes of sounds, including goshawk calls, using a convolutional neural network. To establish the system's applicability as a survey method, we then additionally verified three factors; (1) applicability of the method in different locales, (2) optimal distance from the nest to recording device, and (3) the ability to gauge reproductive states. We report an overall accuracy of 97.0% for this system. This system could classify, with high accuracy, goshawk calls ``kek-kek-kek'' and ``whee-oo'' across different locales. This system could classify sounds collected by recorders placed far from nests and within the forest, not placed on the nest itself. Some limitations of the system, notably limitation in data for verification, remain to be improved through further studies. This survey method can be used to judge whether an area was inhabited by goshawks or not, and their approximate reproductive state, based on a three-hour recording of environmental sounds, with required fieldwork limited to the placing and collection of recorders, and minimal additional human input, due to the system classifying the sounds automatically.","tags":["\"Bird call classification\"","\"Bird call detection\"","\"Convolutional neural network (CNN)\"","\"Monitoring\"","\"Northern goshawk\"","\"Raptor surveys\""],"title":"A New Survey Method Using Convolutional Neural Networks for Automatic Classification of Bird Calls","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Junko Morimoto","Masahiro Aiba","Flavio Furukawa","Yoshio Mishima","Nobuhiko Yoshimura","Sridhara Nayak","Tetsuya Takemi","Haga Chihiro","Takanori Matsui","Futoshi Nakamura"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1625386194,"objectID":"36abe225963456e3f37cba2b00de7239","permalink":"https://hagachi.github.io/publication/morimoto-risk-assessment-forest-2021-a/","publishdate":"2021-07-03T02:46:28.74781Z","relpermalink":"/publication/morimoto-risk-assessment-forest-2021-a/","section":"publication","summary":"Under future climate regimes, the risk of typhoons accompanied by heavy rains is expected to increase. Although the risk of disturbance to forest stands by strong winds has long been of interest, we have little knowledge of how the process is mediated by storms and precipitation. Using machine learning, we assess the disturbance risk to cool-temperate forests by typhoons that landed in northern Japan in late August 2016 to determine the features of damage caused by typhoons accompanied by heavy precipitation, discuss how the process is mediated by precipitation as inferred from the modelling results, and delineate the effective solutions for forest management to decrease the future risk in silviculture. In the results, we confirmed two types of behaviours in the model: one represents the same process as that of forest disturbance by strong wind, which has been widely studied, and another represents a unique process mediated by storms and precipitation that has not been previously investigated. Specifically, the ridges that received strong wind from the front side had the highest risk of disturbance. Precipitation increased the probability of disturbance in forest stands, and its effect was dependent on the dominant species composition. Our hypothesis regarding treefall mediated by storms and precipitation is that rainwater flows into the gaps around the tree root systems during sway and the introduction of rainwater below the root-soil plate decreases the root anchorage. The species-specific vulnerability to rainfall may depend on the volume of lateral roots. Modelling the disturbance risk helped us to examine the kinds of factors that were related to exposure and vulnerability that should be managed to effectively decrease the risk of disturbance by typhoons during future uncontrollable hazards. It is recommended to avoid silviculture on the ridges of plateaus considering the high risk estimated in this area. In addition, species with dense lateral roots would be suitable for planting because they may have high resistance to typhoons with heavy precipitation.","tags":["\"Climate change\"","\"Forest structure\"","\"Risk assessment\"","\"Topography\"","\"Total precipitation\"","\"Windthrow\""],"title":"Risk Assessment of Forest Disturbance by Typhoons with Heavy Precipitation in Northern Japan","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Haga, Chihiro","吳恩達"],"categories":["Demo","教程"],"content":"Overview  The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.

However, the poorly designed introduction of RE can cause conflicts between energy production and biodiversity conservation. This study conducted a scenario analysis to evaluate potential conflicts in the nexuses between energy and biodiversity for a case study area, the Bekambeushi River watershed located in northeastern Japan. The increasing rate of pastureland abandonment resulting from a decreasing farmer population is a source of great uncertainty in this area. Two alternative sources of RE were selected to utilize these abandoned pasturelands, each taking a contrasting approach to meet targets stipulated by regional energy plans, thereby implying different ecological consequences at the landscape level. Thirty-one RE introduction cases were simulated, comprising a range of pastureland abandonment expansion speeds and ratios of solar photovoltaic (PV) plant installation to biomass energy use. These were superimposed using two IPCC representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios, 2.6 and 8.5, resulting in 62 cases that were summarized as three scenarios based on the RE supply– demand balance and the ecological impacts. The LANDIS-II model was used to simulate these scenarios from 2016 to 2100. The results indicate that both the rate of pastureland abandonment and the ratio of the two RE sources had a large impact on changes in tree species diversity and the habitat suitability of raptorial birds. Abandoned pastureland converted to tree biomass energy production shifted to pioneer species-dominated forest. The plant species composition of transitional forests varied between the climate scenarios. The higher temperature of the RCP 8.5 scenario toward 2100 prevented the establishment of Betula platyphylla and altered tree species diversity and the habitat suitability of Ketupa blakistoni blakistoni. Biomass energy utilization produced less energy than the demand but increased the three ecological indicators. Solar PV systems provided more energy than the regional demand, but the three ecological indicators decreased. However, an appropriate mixture of the two RE sources satisfied the regional energy demand and maintained ecological conditions. Our results suggest that land– energy planning should consider energy– biodiversity nexuses to a strike balance between decarbonization and biodiversity conservation.","tags":["\"Climate Change\"","\"Farmland abandonment\"","\"LANDIS-II\"","\"Renewable energy mix\"","\"Solar Power Generation\"","\"woody biomass energy\""],"title":"Scenario Analysis of Renewable Energy–Biodiversity Nexuses Using a Forest Landscape Model","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ayana Fujimoto","Chihiro Haga","Takanori Matsui","Takashi Machimura","Kiichiro Hayashi","Satoru Sugita","Hiroaki Takagi"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1564617600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1625386194,"objectID":"7b0a24eaf469b70c8c92eb9f3e028006","permalink":"https://hagachi.github.io/publication/fujimoto-end-end-process-2019-b/","publishdate":"2021-07-03T02:46:27.618636Z","relpermalink":"/publication/fujimoto-end-end-process-2019-b/","section":"publication","summary":"To promote Bio-Energy with Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage (BECCS), which aims to replace fossil fuels with bio energy and store carbon underground, and Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+), which aims to reduce the carbon emissions produced by forest degradation, it is important to build forest management plans based on the scientific prediction of forest dynamics.

This process could detect 93.4% of individual trees, successfully classified two species using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with 83.6% accuracy and evaluated future ecosystem carbon dynamics and the source-sink balance using individual based model FORMIND. Further ideas for improving the sub-process of the end to end process were discussed.

In Japan, the shrinking and aging population will likely lead to a situation of underuse of natural resources, resulting in rewilding of terrestrial ecosystems. This study conducted a quantitative scenario analysis of natural capital and ESs by linking model and social scenarios on a local scale. The case study area was the Bekanbeushi River Watershed in Northern Japan. LANDIS-II model (a forest landscape model) was used to simulate the vegetation dynamics in species composition, age structure, and biomass considering impacts of forest and pasture land management. Four ``population distribution'' and ``capital preference'' scenarios were translated into forest and pasture land management. The population distribution and capital preference assumptions resulted in different consequences for natural capital and ESs. The population distribution affected the spatial allocation of abandoned pasture land and level of isolation of managed pasture land. The capital preference assumptions largely affected the consequences for ESs. Finally, these simulation results demonstrated the capacity to feed quantitative information to the narrative scenarios. Our process-based approach provides insight into the relationships among social drivers, ecological processes, and the consequences that will affect natural capital and ESs, which can contribute to decision-making and sustainability design of regions, which may face issues associated with underuse in the future.","tags":[],"title":"Simulation of Natural Capital and Ecosystem Services in a Watershed in Northern Japan Focusing on the Future Underuse of Nature: By Linking Forest Landscape Model and Social Scenarios","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Takanori Matsui","Chihiro Haga","Osamu Saito","Shizuka Hashimoto"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1625386194,"objectID":"96990a02f80f8c3e2d41d0d414fa77c4","permalink":"https://hagachi.github.io/publication/matsui-spatially-explicit-residential-2019-b/","publishdate":"2021-07-03T02:46:28.612889Z","relpermalink":"/publication/matsui-spatially-explicit-residential-2019-b/","section":"publication","summary":"In scenario studies of biodiversity and ecosystem services, the population distribution is one of the key driving forces.

Four narrative scenarios were proposed by the PANCES project using two axes as major uncertainties: the population distribution and the capital preference. The residential population and the working population in primary industries were calculated using a gravity-based allocation algorithm in a manner consistent with the storylines of the PANCES scenarios. Using the population distribution assumption by scenario, the population was overlaid with the natural capital and the supply potential of ecosystem services. The results supported to understand the gaps between natural capital and maintainability, and the potential of ecosystem services and realizability.

In line with this, the study aimed to explore how alternative development pathways influence future land-use patterns, biodiversity and ecosystem services against a rapidly declining population in the Noto peninsula of Japan. By combining land-use simulation and evaluation of ecosystem services, the study formulated four exploratory scenarios for 2050, assuming a contrasting level of the society's reliance on domestic natural capital and different demographic patterns. At first, we analyzeds historical landuse changes between 1997 and 2007 and thereby simulated four plausible alternative scenarios using the Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Network model. These scenarios were further used to quantify ecosystem services and landscape heterogeneity (as biodiversity indicator). The scenario analysis demonstrated that future land-use pattern could vary drastically depending on how the society utilize local natural capital even under the severe depopulation trend, whereas demographic patterns, in general, did not make discernible differences in land-use, biodiversity and ecosystem services. Nevertheless, a land-use change made considerable differences in the level of ecosystem services and landscape heterogeneity with varying degrees. Our analysis suggested that ecosystem services such as food production and nitrogen retention as well as landscape heterogeneity would decrease considerably by 2050 under the scenarios where the utilization of local natural capital decline and a significant amount of farmland are abandoned. Our findings highlight the vital role of land-use and agricultural policy in shaping the future availability of ecosystem services and biodiversity in this area.","tags":[],"title":"Scenario Analysis of Land-Use and Ecosystem Services of Social-Ecological Landscapes: Implications of Alternative Development Pathways under Declining Population in the Noto Peninsula, Japan","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"このプロジェクトでは主に現在の生態系の状態を観測することに焦点を当てています。\n現在の生態系の状態を把握することは生物多様性保全のために必須ですが、人口減少で人手が減る中で、広域の森林や野生生物を調査するのはとても困難です。そこで、機械学習を用いてドローンや衛星画像から森林属性情報を取得・識別したり、音声録音データから鳥類の種を判別する技術開発を行っています。\n民間企業と分析技術の実装で技術連携しつつ、大学構内や福島県などを対象に研究開発しています。\n","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1625800749,"objectID":"ee561c1aa88114538f9d26b5efcc12b0","permalink":"https://hagachi.github.io/project/biomonitoring/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/biomonitoring/","section":"project","summary":"This project applied machine learning technologies for biomonitoring.","tags":["biodiversity","acaustic monitoring","machine learning"],"title":"Assisting Biomonitoring using Data-science Technologies","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"生物多様性・再生可能エネルギーのネクサス解明に取り組んでいます。プロジェクトのURLはこちら！ https://github.com/Green-Engineers-Lab/REROUTES\n","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"fa5df8e3814da9ef8336714f3414345a","permalink":"https://hagachi.github.io/project/nexus/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/nexus/","section":"project","summary":"This project aims to identify nexuses between biodiversity and renewable energy.","tags":["nexus","Climate Change","Biodiversity","Ecosystem Services"],"title":"Nexus between biodiversity and renewable energy","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"今後日本の森林や農地など陸域生態系は、気候変動の影響を受けつつ、人口減少や再エネ導入など社会からの駆動力で植生が変化することが予想されます。そこで、Forest Landscape Modelを応用し、起こり得る将来シナリオでの植生動態・生態系サービス・野生生物の生息適性の変化をシミュレーションしています。環境・社会・経済の観点から、持続可能な生態系管理の具体化に挑戦しています。\n研究の対象地域は別寒辺牛川流域、道南地域 (北海道)、奥会津地域 (福島県)、石川県、琵琶湖・淀川流域で、私の学士過程から継続中のメインテーマです。\n","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1625800749,"objectID":"2c6529a406ee1bf9153830cea2560d20","permalink":"https://hagachi.github.io/project/scenario-analysis/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/scenario-analysis/","section":"project","summary":"This project conducted scenario analysis of Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services.","tags":["LANDIS-II","Climate Change","Biodiversity","Ecosystem Services","Nexus"],"title":"Scenario analysis of Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services","type":"project"},{"authors":["Chihiro Haga","Takanori Matsui","Takashi Machimura"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1625386194,"objectID":"b13732fd949747dc9aed38fc9c5a6a81","permalink":"https://hagachi.github.io/publication/haga-development-simulation-process-2016/","publishdate":"2021-07-03T02:46:27.747573Z","relpermalink":"/publication/haga-development-simulation-process-2016/","section":"publication","summary":"The sustainable management of Satoyama landscape is a major to realize a society in harmony with nature.

And we discussed on the utility and future tasks in applying the developed simulation process for future scenario analysis of satoyama landscape.","tags":["\"abandoned farmland\"","\"forest management\"","\"LANDIS-II\"","\"M-SI\"","\"Satoyama landscapes\""],"title":"A Development of Simulation Process of Landscape Diversity in Satoyama Landscape for Future Scenario Assessment —Using the Landis-Ii Model and the Modified Satoyama Index—","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1625386194,"objectID":"f26b5133c34eec1aa0a09390a36c2ade","permalink":"https://hagachi.github.io/admin/config.yml","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/admin/config.yml","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"wowchemycms"}]
